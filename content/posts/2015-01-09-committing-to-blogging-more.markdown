I think blogging is kind of like flossing. I should do it more, and it doesn't even have to cost me much time. But I somehow struggle to make time for it.

There's a term for our failure to do what we want to do: *akrasia*. Like any aspect of human nature, it's been studied, some things are understood about it, and there are some things you can do to try and manage it.

One such class of coping mechanisms is called a commitment device. Basically, in a moment of clarity you decide what you are going to do in the future, and you constrain your future self so that he will find it less convenient to shirk his responsibility than to just follow through.

I've started using a commitment device service called Beeminder. It's early and I've had mixed results, but I'm happy enough with the service to expand its auspices tonight to my blogging output.

I, Nicholas McAvoy, pledge to write at least two blog posts per week from here on out.

### Back it up, McAvoy.

All right, I will. Should I fail to maintain this pace at any point, I will give $5 to my friend Beeminder. You can actually see how I'm doing. It's public knowledge; just go right [here](https://www.beeminder.com/ohbadiah/blog-posts).

Yup, that's the commitment. Future me will have to choose between blogging and coughing up Honest Abe. Hopefully that's all the motivation it takes. After all, that's all it's taken to get me to read 10 pages a day for a couple of weeks now.

Aw, now I feel good about myself. Let's just say though that I am not so easily motivated in every aspect of life:

It's like watching an episode of *ER*. Yup, $5 was not enough during Christmas week to get me to adopt the work schedule I thought would be most helpful. I crashed and failed. 

But you know what? My friend Beeminder didn't give up on me. No, Beeminder was happy to let me try again. But since $5 was evidently not enough to motivate me, Beeminder put me on the hook for $10. Twice as motivating, right! Well, like anyone who knows me, Beeminder is realizing I am not very corrigible. I crashed *again* during New Years week. Now I'm on the hook for $30. This is getting serious!

Anyway, two blog posts per week seems perfectly reasonable to me. In fact, with this post I'm already halfway there for the week!
