I got a few comments about [my last post](/muse/posts/2015/05/15/symbology/). In the picture of me in the barber chair, everyone I heard from noticed another symbol more than those I intended to highlight:

![No, not the bra hanging there.](/img/symbology.jpg)

I'm referring to the knife. I hadn't thought much of the knife, and that highlights some interesting points about symbology, or semiotics as I've learned it's more formally called.

I did some research on the subject, by which I mean I asked someone far more knowledgeable to enlighten my ignorance. [Matthew](https://twitter.com/jamesmafyew)'s kind response (emphasis mine):

<pre class="prose">
Probably the term you're looking for is semiotics, which I did work on in college. The upshot of all that work: nothing means anything. The whole postmodern goof is that we can all wear Che Guevara and Mao shirts that we bought at Urban Outfitters, and pull it off without being perceived as hypocritical communist militants. Appropriation is fine because in a postmodern semiotics, meaning is only constructed, and is relative in a strict sense...poststructuralism finds that signs have no essential meaning. All meaning is mediated, and therefore all meaning of signs is created through their juxtaposition with other signs. Enough juxtapositions create a context, then a consensus. For symbols to mean something, groups of people have to agree on what they mean. <b>That doesn't happen in a postmodern society where the speed of appropriation is orders of magnitude faster than the speed of consensus-forming.</b>

To illustrate these principles, let's talk about the knife. A commenter offered an interpretation:

<pre class="prose">
I note the hand thrusting what appears to be a blood-stained knife on the wall behind you. This is just below the words "Thank you", and to the right of "CASH ONLY". I suppose the message here is use cash, or be stabbed.

Get this: the barber shop accepts credit cards.

Why would they imply a rather harsh message that wasn't even true? Well, they weren't. These signs don't mean what they seem to from the perspective of an American English-speaking observer. In fact, I've observed that in Korea English words very often don't mean what they, you know, mean.

My first week here I asked my friend about her sweater that said ALABAMA across the front. I was pretty sure she had never been to Alabama, nor did she root for any of the college sports Alabama invests so heavily in. "Oh, it's always foreigners that ask me that question," she explained. __"Koreans know it doesn't mean anything."__

Now, it's not that *nothing* is meant by CASH ONLY and the knife. Rather, these signs were part of a suite that intended to convey a certain masculinity. Take some other signs around the room, not all of them visible in the picture:

- the bra hanging there
- a framed print of a scantily clad woman posing suggestively with a barber pole, invoking an intertwined history of barber shops and prostitution in Korea
- a 4x6 print of Jesus playing billiards while smoking a cigarrette
- the word SEX scrawled under the light switch by the door

Naively, these symbols are way over the top. I might have been offended by them or even intimidated. I wasn't for a few reasons though. Foremost, I think "the barber shop" as I know it is literally a foreign concept in Korea. The barber shop in which I grew up was indeed a center for the transmission of a much healthier and more balanced masculinity. At Mr. Jugan's barber shop the barber would tell actual war stories or stories of warding off predators from his farm or give advice for saving for retirement, while old man friends of his would simply hang out and shoot the breeze. It's this history that leads me to seek out someplace like it wherever I go, whether the Original Gent in Phoenixville or Groom in Philadelphia or now the Outro in Seoul.

I believe it is aspects of this tradition that the Outro is trying access in Korea, where there is far less context for it. Therefore its symbols need to speak far more loudly in order to be understood by Korean observers. In interpreting them, remembering that English in Korea is often just decoration anyway, it is necessary to tone down their amplitude significantly.

Additionally, the proprietors are about my age, not nearly as old or as wise as Mr. Jugan, and sadly they may not know a better masculinity than conveyed by these symbols.

As further illustration of this principle, the first thing I was told after seeing the "walk-ins welcome" placard on the sidewalk and entering was that they require reservations. "But it says walk-ins!" I protested. The barber who received me suppressed a laugh and, after deliberating, asked if I would be willing to wait 20 minutes before my haircut. 20 minutes! That's standard practice in the barber shop as I knew it growing up. Of course I would have no problem waiting; waiting is almost part of the point when the shop is functioning as intended.

So indeed, the symbols used in the barber shop mean nothing in themselves. To understand them requires considerable shared context. I had to really dig deep to try to understand everything. The result was one of the best haircuts I've ever had and a new friend in my barber, who was far from the barbar the room indicated.

I will do well to understand these principles if I really seek to be understood by way of symbololgy.
