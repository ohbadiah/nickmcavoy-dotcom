Now that was the way it is supposed to be.

At 8:35 I looked at the clock and sighed a contented sigh. Two hours earlier I had left work. Two hours had been enough time to catch the train, ride my bike home, and cook and eat a satisfying meal despite having no prior plan.

That's what my CSA is supposed to do for me. CSA stands for community-supported agriculture. It's basically a vegetable subscription. I sign up for a season and every week I pick up a box of goods from farms in Lancaster County. Everything is fresh and organic and, Pennsylvania being the bounteous land that it is, there is a lot of variety.

Without the CSA I likely would have eaten out somewhere. But with it, even though I had given no thought to Thursday dinner before Thursday evening I had plenty to work with without needing to stop at the store. I ended up cooking up some CSA baby red Russian kale and shiitake mushrooms along with some onion, garlic, and lemon I had on hand. I served it on thin toasted slices of the sourdough bread I make every week. It hit the spot!

And so I achieved something very rare for me: a delicious, satisfying meal that did not take much time, effort, or planning. After finishing I had so much time left over I decided to write a blog post.
