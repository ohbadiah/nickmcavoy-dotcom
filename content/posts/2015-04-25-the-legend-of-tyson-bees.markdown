I spent the Christmas of 2010 in San Francisco with my Uncle Paul's family and visiting cousins Anthony and Ami. It was a great trip. I had a blast with everyone and I got to see Yosemite National Park and I made killer chipotle cheeseburger sliders for Christmas Eve dinner.

One thing I didn't get to do that I had hoped to was to try some Korean tacos. I had heard about Korean tacos and they seemed like a really good idea but no one was doing them in Philly. Hoping Norcal would have some love for me I looked up a food truck that sold them in San Fran, but they understandably weren't going to be opening during Christmas week. With this one minor regret I returned home otherwise quite satisfied back to my job coding for a research lab at Penn.

The very next week I set out to bike to Trader Joe's during my lunch hour. I rounded the corner onto 33rd from Spruce and just about fell off the saddle.

That was one gorgeous truck sitting there. It spoke to me and I pulled right over. Thus I entered into the Legend of Tyson Bee's.

The truck looked like it materialized out of some fantasy land where everything was good and right, so it was no surprise to me that they did indeed sell Korean tacos. $8 got me three of those Korean barbecue short rib wonders, topped with kimchi at my request, again and again and again. They were everything I hoped they would be.

Food trucks had been in Philly long before I got there, but Tyson Bee's was something new. To understand the difference take Frita's, my favorite truck during my undergraduate years. Frita's set up shop in front of the physics building and sold cheesesteaks and pretzels and other normal Philly stuff. They had killer mustard. An endearing old Greek couple ran the truck. Trucks like these were often great American stories and you'd hear about children of immigrant owners going to Penn eventually. I once met the son of The Real Le Anh and he did indeed go to Wharton. The point is you could count on this food to be cheap and satisfying and good in a mostly ordinary sense, a kind of comfort food, but nothing to push any culinary boundaries.

But Tyson Bee's was no first-generation affair. Second-generation chefs like Tyson Wong Ophaso knew how to connect with their audiences on multiple levels. Not only was the food amazing and boundary-pushing but as you might expect from the paint job the atmosphere of the truck was very fun. For example, you'd get a playing card when you placed your order so you could relax while you waited for "eight of spades" or "King of diamonds" to be called out. I was always bringing new friends to try the truck out and I would be so gratified when Cliff in the truck gave me free Thai tea for the loyalty.

I wasn't the only one who noticed. The truck became a sensation. The crowds were huge but the service was still quick and so it only added to the atmosphere. My coworker Mike and me would egg one another on to the truck, usually successfully. The kimchi barbecue beef short rib burrito was also a favorite, or I'd get the O.G. dog, a delicious dog topped with (you guessed it) kimchi. They also had an award-winning pork bun, other kinds of tacos, and curry dishes. Nothing struck out; everything was good for at least two bases.

You might expect that such a truck would disrupt the balance of the local food truck scene. You'd be right. I went to Frita's after my grad class one day for old time's sake. "How are things going, Frita?" I asked. A wave of anxiety came back at me. Business was not good. I tried to play dumb and pretend I couldn't perceive the crowd at Tyson Bee's half a block away.

"We've gone through slow periods before, but there's something different about right now." Well I sure felt bad. It's all fun and games when everyone is in kalbi heaven, but no one wants to see hard-working septuagenarians whose cooking got you through quantum mechanics put out on the street. As I ate my cheesesteak by the tennis court my heart was moved for Frita and I prayed for her business. "Dear God, please help Frita's truck. Please provide some way for them to stay in business."

Now, Almighty God could have answered that prayer a hundred different ways. His ways are mysterious, and why he would choose to answer that prayer the way it seems he may have is beyond me. As a matter of fact, I wish he would have done it differently! All I know is, very soon after that prayer, no more than a week later, the unthinkable happened. We didn't know what to make of early reports, but all we knew was none of the original crew was serving from the truck and the food wasn't the same.

The story as I was able to piece it together from other food truck owners and the Internet is that the capital behind the truck killed the golden goose. As the story has it they pressured the talent to compromise on ingredient quality but charge the same price. Given the truck's runaway success that kind of tension is not too shocking. I don't know the full story but whatever happened the labor and the capital split. The chefs must have thought they would have no problem finding another gig, and the owners must have thought they'd have no trouble finding replacements to cook the same food.

I haven't seen evidence that either was right. For a couple of months afterward Mike would still try to tell me that while the food wasn't quite as good at Tyson Bee's it was still worth having. I wanted to believe him but my taste buds told me otherwise. Before summer's end we gave up altogether. The truck might still be there, but it was dead to us.

As for Cliff and Tyson and the whole crew, I've seen neither head nor tail of any of them since that time. I heard a rumor that they were relaxing in northern California off of their buyout. Supposedly too Ophaso was going to open a brick-and-mortar restaurant in Philly the next year. That never materialized.

You can still go to Tyson Bee's. After those six magical months it's been a shell of its former self for far longer than it taught us how to taste for lunch. Judging by recent Yelp reviews they're still cooking the same menu. The scores aren't bad so the quality may have even improved of late. Mostly though I bet today's hungry university students and staff don't know what they're missing. Shifting baselines.

We'll always have that January, sweet in my remembrance.
