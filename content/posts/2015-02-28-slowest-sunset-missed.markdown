Lewis's Ransom wouldn't have done it this way.

I've already crossed half the ocean today. I can't take much credit for that feat, but I do appreciate it. I'm not sure about everyone else on the plane, though. It's beautiful blue broad daylight out there, or so I infer. I am left to inference because every window shade in my surroundings is drawn closed.

I would be a little more sympathetic if we were flying east. Seeing the outside world in fast-forward might be disorienting. But we left at 12:30 in the afternoon, and because WE ARE TRAVELING AT AN APPRECIABLE FRACTION OF THE EARTH'S ROTATIONAL VELOCITY it will only be 6:30 PM when we land. We could be treated to the long, slow descent of the sun from its near-equinoxal zenith to its gentle laying down to rest as we arrive at our destination. We could not invent a more suitable way to mark our journey! Nothing could help our bodies better understand the marvel we are receiving, the better to adjust to our new frame of reference! But I suppose it might be harder to see the TV screens on our seat backs.

This is my fault. I was supposed to be on a flight that left three days ago. I planned poorly and I had to delay my departure and on such short notice there were no window seats available. Make no mistake, were I in charge of the shade and a half left to my comatose and perhaps drugged-out neighbor, things would be different around here.

I am reminded of *Out of the Silent PLanet.*

In that book, C.S. Lewis's first foray into science fiction, his heroic philologist protagonist Ransom is kidnapped into outer space. But this was not the outer space of most other writers. It was not a cruel, cold void that gave the lie to any pretension of meaning or purpose for humanity in the solar system. Rather it was a theater of glory. Ransom basked naked in the sun's radiation and soaked up its vitality. The space between the planets was the domain of heavenly beings absent from Earth because awaiting a rescue operation.

The voyage into outer space did indeed reveal to Ransom something of humanity's place in the cosmos, but the underlying cosmology was not existentialist but thoroughly Christian. We might learn similarly today. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork. I wish I were in a glass cabin fully exposed to the marvel we are receiving. Instead we shut ourselves out, preferring our own constructs and illusions. `
