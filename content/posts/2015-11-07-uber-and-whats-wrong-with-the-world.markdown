title: Uber and What's Wrong with the World

What do you think about Uber? I think it's pretty popular, and they're certainly making gobs of money. But I think it's basically evil and represents much of what I find frustrating about the world. 

If you have some time, this [excellent journalism](http://citypaper.net/uberdriver) in the sadly now-defunct Philadelphia Citypaper illustrates most of why. But I'll summarize. Why is taking Uber better than taking a taxi?

<!-- MORE -->

- Taxis are bound up in a labyrinthine knot of regulation that is in dire need of reform but which few parties have had much interest in reforming. Uber solves this by ignoring regulations and operating illegally.

- Uber is at an enormous advantage in that basically all of the risk of its enterprise is assumed by its drivers. If a driver is caught doing this illegal operation, the driver pays the fine. Moreover, Uber drivers are uninsured when they drive; their personal policies won't cover a commercial situation like this. So if there's an accident it's on the driver. Finally, the driver supplies and maintains the capital as well!

- Since Uber's drivers aren't part of Uber, their interests aren't aligned, and Uber often acts contrary to the interests of its drivers. For instance when it moves into a new market it will attract drivers with higher rates that it then slashes to boost passenger demand. Plus, as soon as it can Uber will replace all of them with robots.

So why would anyone drive for Uber?

- Uber's harsh policies toward their drivers benefit consumers too, and consumers love Uber. Better to drive for Uber illegally than for a taxi with no fares.

- They are very successful with their propaganda, sorry, advertising.  Terms like "sharing economy" make it sound like Uber is providing a way for "the rest of us" to make it in this crazy world.

- This situation may still be better for many drivers than the alternative, because many people are already in bad situations.

So I think Uber is basically exploitative, and when you take an Uber you're exploiting someone too even as you sign yourself up for the same kind of exploitation tech giants are always leveraging against their consumers.

Maybe you don't disagree with much of this, but you think basically nothing wrong is happening because no one's freedom of contract is being abridged, and trying to intervene actually would abridge people's freedom of contract and would likely make things worse. I'm sympathetic to that; I'm conservative in that I think it's essential we operate in
the world that exists rather than insisting a different world exist.

But let's take a step back. Let's enumerate all the things Uber actually provides:

- A nice app
- ...
- Am I missing anything?

Yes, maybe we can defeat Uber by offering a superior competitor. I think whether or not this is possible has a lot to do with whether or not justice is possible in this world. Which is to say, sometimes it is and often it isn't, and come Lord Jesus, come.

I don't know much about ownership structures, but something like a driver-owned cooperative seems like a great candidate for solving this problem. Bring such a co-op into existence and give it software as good as Uber's, and they will put onto the market a product that costs more than Uber's but which is better for the world. Maybe in the long-run both offerings continue to occupy their own niches, like how Mariposa Food Co-op exists alongside traditional supermarkets in West Philly.

But equilibria have inertia, so the superiority of this reality does not ensure a transition from our inferior reality will occur. A lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to put its pants on, as they say. Or, as [this article](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3051845/the-peoples-uber-why-the-sharing-economy-must-share-ownership) puts it, "Uber and Airbnb have grown not just on their own merits, but thanks to an ecosystem of high-risk investors, incubators, coding schools, government incentives, and tech conferences. Platform cooperativism needs an ecosystem of its own."

I'm heartened to see [Platform Cooperativism](http://platformcoop.net/) gathering in New York this week. Maybe just such an ecosystem can begin to get off the ground. If I worked for a company like that it would be cool to have my labor advancing a cause I support as well.
