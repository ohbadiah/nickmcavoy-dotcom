There are two men in whose shadow I most often think of myself as walking. The first is my father. The second is myself as a child.

Some people name their cars. I think that's cool but I've never been able to come up with an appropriate name for my cars. I cherish my bikes more, but I haven't been able to come up with anything appropriate for either of them. Until now, that is. I've come up with a name for my late-70's English racing bike by Raleigh.

I call it the Original Catastrophe.
