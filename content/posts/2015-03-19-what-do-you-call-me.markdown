A couple of friends who are far more traveled than I shared [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/mar/13/white-people-expats-immigrants-migration) recently, entitled "Why are white people expats when the rest of us are immigrants?" The author argues that "expat" is a privileged word "created with the purpose of putting white people above everyone else." People called "expats" should really just be called "immigrants" like everyone else.

I appreciated giving thought to the subject because I had wondered what to call myself as I spend the year in South Korea. "Expat" hasn't felt quite right and so I've been reluctant to apply it. However "immigrant" doesn't seem right either.

This may be a peculiarity of my education, but "expat" to me has always conjured images of Hemingway smoking a cigarette in a salon in Paris. These expatriates were not merely journeying away from their home country but rather they were alienated from it. Yet neither were they at home in their new place. Perhaps they were wanderers who were lost. As one who aspires [to not be lost even as I wander](/yhwh/posts/2014/12/07/not-all-who-wander-are-lost/), this word feels wrong to me. If I truly felt like an expat I think I would have to return home.

So I have no problem spurning "expat" and any associated privilege, because the privilege of being defined neither by origin nor by dwelling place is worthless in my estimation. However, "immigrant" doesn't make sense to me either unless I actually plan to, you know, immigrate. If rather than journeying away from home in Seoul for a time I were to say that Seoul is my home now, then I would be an immigrant. But Seoul is not my home; Philadelphia is, and I long for it even as I am glad for and committed to this journey.

I actually got the word I'm comfortable with from Korean, and it's so simple I had to laugh. My friend referred to me as 외국인, which means "foreigner," or literally "person from a foreign country." Of course! I'm a foreigner. So far as I can tell the word connotes nothing beyond being from another country, with no complicated layers of meaning along with it. It's simple, and it's perfect. Call me that.
