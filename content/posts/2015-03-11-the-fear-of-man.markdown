Nobody wants to look stupid. That's part of the problem.


These days I'm staying in South Korea, a foreign country where my command of the language is elementary at best. That I'm a foreigner is very obvious because of my ethnicity.

I've been a little surprised as I've been getting adjusted here to notice how much I fear embarrassment. It's taken me a bit to warm up to asking anything in Korean for fear of getting the words wrong or having awful pronunciation or not being able to understand the answer. I might be self-conscious too about stepping off to the side while walking to make sure I know where I'm going, or about looking at a map.

It makes no sense.

A foreigner is by definition someone for whom there are no set expectations. If I were a known quantity I wouldn't be foreign. There's little I could do that would break the mold of society's expectations for me because there is no such mold.


Yet I still find that what people will think is a significant motivator for me. It's irrational. As unlikely as I am to see any stranger again at home, I am orders of magnitude less likely to see a stranger in Seoul again. I'm not doing anything criminal or more shameful than being away from home. Any confusion or misstep does not matter and no one cares but me.

I've gotten a little more comfortable in this freedom since arriving. Here's hoping I can come even to enjoy it.
