All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

So begins a poem by Bilbo Baggins by J.R.R. Tolkien about a wanderer in the North whose was rightfully the throne in the South. The first two lines of the poem have stuck with me particularly. Along with the ways of Aragorn and Gandalf in Tolkien's work and such other characters as the Legend of Zelda's Link, they present to me a compelling model for the fruitful life of a single person.

Many find the notion that "Not all those who wander are lost" appealing, particularly in our rather placeless age. You can even buy an iPhone case with the words on it. As a proponent in the past of [placefulness](http://ohbadiah.blogspot.com/search/label/placefulness) in claiming the same I might seem to contradict myself, yet I do not think that it is so.

Surely it is not enough merely to assert that not all who wander are lost. After all, doing so acknowledges that perhaps most who wander *are* lost. The burden of proof is on he who would take the words to his lips. How is it, then, that one wanders and yet is not lost?

For myself I offer two answers. First, wherever I may wander, I am a Philadelphian. I am defined and shaped by that origin and I carry it with me wherever I go, most visibly in the form of a red baseball cap. When I go to New York I go as an unappointed emissary from Philadelphia seeking to be a gift from Philadelphia to New York. Places I wander are distinct else-wheres, not essentially indistinguishable as are two points on a blank sphere. I wander from home always with a mind to return to it.

Even more significantly, all Christians are to understand themselves truly as pilgrims. A pilgrim is one who is not home but who is journeying in search of it. In other words pilgrims are wanderers, yet they are not lost.

But what is our home? As Christians we believe that "our citizenship is in Heaven." Whatever our affiliations, they subordinate to our fealty to the kingdom of Jesus Christ. This kingdom is different from nation-states as we know them, being "not of this world," and yet it is like them: it is a tangible geopolitical reality that begins to be realized in the present and will be fully realized in the future, when citizens "of every tribe and nation and tongue" will be gathered into one at a great wedding feast. So we live in an already-and-not-yet paradox.

That might sound abstract, but many implications of thinking of ourselves as pilgrims are very concrete. For instance for those who put their hope in this kingdom parting is never the last word in our relationships, even though we each go our own ways and thence to our own graves. Yet after that we will all be summoned to table at the consummation of the Kingdom to live together forevermore. A hope from our Hope is that while parting is transient, union is forever.

I am in the midst of two months of wandering, a preface to a year's journey to a far-off country. I have already visited Providence, Washington D.C., and Williamstown, and now I ride my fourth bus of the day to Portland. Next month Austin, Minneapolis, and Phoenix will know my footsteps. Let none doubt that I wander. In each of these places I go to some with whom I have shared life before and yet who have moved away from Philadelphia to new homes and jobs and lives. In some cases it would be easy enough to let these relationships fall into disuse. Yet I go to them as a testimony to the coming of the kingdom, a reunion in anticipation of our Reunion, a rehearsal of the resurrection.

I wander, and yet I know exactly where I am going.
