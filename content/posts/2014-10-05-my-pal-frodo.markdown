I'm rereading the Lord of the Rings. It's awesome. So many of Tolkien's characters are worth emulating. It really is a book that is likely to make you a better person.

It might be easy to forget Frodo among greater heroes like Gandalf and Aragorn, but I think doing so would be a mistake. At any rate in the first chapters of book IV of the story, I found a couple of aspects of Frodo I both relate and aspire to.

The first is his frankness. I think frankness, of meaning what you say and saying what you mean, is a virtue. It's similar to Jesus's command to "let your yes be yes, and your no be no." To be frank is like having integrity. There are doubtless times when more discretion is advisable, but I find it very freeing to have no seam between the self I present and the self I perceive.

Once I was dating a lovely woman named Olivia. We had mutual friends in Zach and Margie, and while visiting at their house early in our time together Olivia asked Zach what she should know about me. "Nick means what he says," Zach said. I never thought of that especially as a trait of mine, but I have since come to realize that it is true.

Frodo too displayed a remarkable frankness when he first encountered Gollum, who had been trailing him for nearly his entire quest and who likely meant Frodo harm. Nevertheless, after explaining to Gollum that he and Sam will not kill Gollum:

  "Yess, yes indeed," said Gollum sitting up. "Nice hobbits! We will come with them. Find them safe paths in the dark, yes we will. And where are they going in these cold hard lands, we wonders, we wonders?" He looked up at them, and a faint light of cunning and eagerness flickered for a second in his pale blinking eyes.
  ...
  Frodo looked straight into Gollum's eyes which flinched and twisted away. "You know that, or you guess well enough, Sm√©agol," he said, quietly and sternly. "We are going to Mordor, of course. And you know the way there, I believe."
  "Ach! sss!" said Gollum, covering his ears with his hands, as if such frankness, and the open speaking of the names, hurt him.

Gollum's question is a power play. While he has a good idea of Frodo's and Sam's business, it is indeed quite secret, and by asking for it he aims to catch them in secrecy or a lie he can use against them. Frodo disarms him completely by telling the simple, terrifying truth.

Another trait I admire in Frodo is his coolness in the face of disturbing uncertainty. Take, for instance, the Hobbits' diminishing supply of food as they journey in a barren and cruel country, hunted by enemy soldiers:

<pre class="prose">
  "About this food," said Sam. "How long's it going to take us to do this job? And when it's done, what are we going to do then? This waybread keeps you on your legs in a wonderful way...But you have to eat some of it every day, and it doesn't grow. I reckon we've got enough to last, say, three weeks or so, and that with a tight belt and a light tooth, mind you. We've been a bit free with it so far."
  "I don't know how long we shall take to - to finish," said Frodo. "We were miserably delayed in the hills. But Samwise Gamgee, my dear hobbit - indeed, Sam my dearest hobbit, friend of friends - I do not think we need give thought to what comes after that. To <i>do the job</i> as you put it - what hope is there that we ever shall? And if we do, who knows what will come of that? If the One goes into the Fire, and we are at hand? I ask you, Sam, are we ever likely to need bread again? I think not. If we can nurse our limbs to bring us to Mount Doom, that is all we can do. More than I can, I begin to feel."
  Sam nodded silently. He took his master's hand and bent over it. He did not kiss it, though his tears fell on it. Then he turned away, drew his sleeve over his nose, and got up, and stamped about, trying to whistle, and saying between his efforts: "Where's that dratted creature?"

Ordinarily running out of food on such a journey would be terrifying, but Frodo could see that they actually had far greater concerns, concerns which made the problem of food completely irrelevant. This kind of stress would build up and overwhelm many people, but Frodo was able to just put it out of his mind.

Such flexibility, comfort improvising, and rational response to uncertainty are qualities I aspire to as well. They are all positive spins on traits characteristic of P's on the Myers-Briggs personality type indicator, a dimension I score highly on. Being a P has lots of negative connotation, like procrastinating, being disorganized, and so on, but Frodo demonstrates P nature at its best.

Recently I was unable to find my wallet as I was leaving the house to meet a friend. I looked for a time, but being reasonably certain the wallet was somewhere in my house I ended up just leaving without it. I figured it would be easier to spot in the next morning's daylight and so I largely put it out of my mind for the evening.

I'm going to keep learning from Frodo as I continue reliving his great adventure.
