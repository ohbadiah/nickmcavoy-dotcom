Does everyone else do this? I suspect not.

I notice that I am an English chameleon. I unconsciously imitate the manner of English spoken by my interlocutor.

For example, when I talk to a Southerner with a drawl, I start drawling myself. It's embarrassed me sometimes because I wonder if my interlocutor will notice and think I am making subtle fun of him or her. At any rate having "y'all" in my arsenal was really empowering last time I was in Texas; I wish the rest of us would adopt it.

This imitation extends even to talking with Koreans in English.

There are certain mannerisms, certain errors common to just about all Korean speakers of English below a certain level of proficiency. Most noticeable are errors with articles. Koreans often leave out indirect articles (*a*, *an*), and they also insert the direct article (*the*) when any article is incorrect. They might say "I have spatula" or "But now that it's the Good Friday..." The former class of error makes sense to me because Korean has no articles, but I don't understand where the latter comes from.

Regardless, I find I intentionally make the same errors when speaking with them. It's interesting to me that I do so because I am more of a linguistic prescriptivist by disposition. That is, I believe that these really are errors, and not some equally legitimate variant of English such as a Southern dialect. Evidently there is some value I hold more dearly than linguistic correctness, even though correct English is perfectly intelligible to my interlocutors and for all I know it might help them to speak more correctly.

Now, I said this English chameleon tendency was subconscious. That doesn't mean I have no control over it. It means as I'm speaking, potential words present themselves to me as a decision tree, with the first inclination being the chameleon's. I could and often do choose to speak "naturally." It probably takes a bit more effort, though.

I've never observed anyone condescending to me in the same way, so I wonder how common it is for other people to do it. My working theory is that it's related to my very high [agreeableness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness). As a general rule I really like other people and want to build up our connection, whatever it may be. Relationally I move toward them, and adjusting my manner of speaking is part of that movement.

I suspect those who are not so agreeable may not be so eager to adjust their speech. But with a sample of only one, I don't have much idea! Do illuminate me.
