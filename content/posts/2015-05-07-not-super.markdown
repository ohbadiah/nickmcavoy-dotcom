Clark Kent was a disguise, right? Superman just wanted to be a normal guy?

I dreamt last night that Superman's powers had come to me. I think you just had to put on the cape and the powers were yours, but the cape had been entrusted to me.

I was leaving some friends in Philadelphia for an appointment somewhere in New Jersey. Being super, obviously I was going to fly. The hitch was I wasn't familiar navigating from thousands of feet in the air. My best plan was to use my smartphone for satellite maps as I went.

The dream wasn't about navigation though. It was about leaving my friends and being unlike them. I looked to them with some bemused incredulity at my predicament, as if to ask, "Who would have ever thought I would end up in this position?" or, "Life sure is crazy, isn't it?" but really it was to beg, "I'm still like you, right?" My friends were sympathetic as far as they could be, but neither of our efforts could bridge the divide between us. After all, I was the one leaving them, and it was because I was super.

This dream doubtless speaks to my feelings about my current unconstrained lifestyle. Only in very recent years has the Internet made it possible for people to earn their living from no place in particular. I have made use of this freedom and it has led me far afield. I've used it [in pursuit of reunion](/nick/posts/2015/02/27/the-once-in-a-lifetime-trip-before-the-once-in-a-lifetime-trip/) and to fulfill a promise from long enough ago that no one still expected me to honor it. Yet there remains a real danger of alienation along with this freedom. Many of the problems that I have, like the dream's problem of navigation while flying, are not problems that many other people have, not the people whose fellowship I seek.

I find myself identifying with elements of [a friend's old tour narrative](http://anchorstates.blogspot.com/2010/08/2010-tour-3.html) ("a sense that I can't reconcile my deepest drives"), itself an example of an extremely rare mode of experience. Maybe indeed [not all who wander are lost](/nick/posts/2014/12/07/not-all-who-wander-are-lost/), but it's probably best not to wander for too long.
