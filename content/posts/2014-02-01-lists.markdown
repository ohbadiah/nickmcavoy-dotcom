I am not very good at getting chores done.

I find the simple act of making a list of tasks greatly increases the likelihood that I will do them. I can have a task in my mind for weeks without doing it, even if it as simple as a phone call. Yet somehow when I make the list something clicks and I start knocking off items.

Who knew?
