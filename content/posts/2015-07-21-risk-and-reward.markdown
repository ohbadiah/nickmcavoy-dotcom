The other weekend I put my finger on a guiding belief of mine I had never consciously named before. It's this: there are abundant resources available in exchange for assuming some risk.

<!-- MORE -->

Now that I think about it I think it's well-understood that people are overly averse to risk. Risk begs caution, but people respond disproportionately. That means there is a disproportionate reward to responding rationally to risk.

Jonathan and I were walking through Times Square on our way to Penn Station. There aren't many situations in America where you have to navigate "traffic" as a pedestrian but this is one of them. The sidewalks tended to move slowly, and we were pressed for time if we were to make it to dinner before our train.

So in several places we stepped off of the sidewalk and walked in the street. We weren't in auto traffic; these places were more like parking lanes that lacked parked cars. But the space was wide open and we moved much faster. In exchange for assuming a negligible amount of risk we were rewarded with unobstructed walkways.

Let's just say that SEPTA is not quite as reliable as Seoul Metro. It is not very uncommon to observe a train or trolley running so late that it arrives just after the next one on the line, which will be running on time. On one such occasion, the train before my normal train to work was half an hour late, arriving about when my train should have. At this moment there were twice as many people waiting at the station as usual. Just about everyone got on the train at this moment, and it was completely packed. I refrained, betting that my train was coming shortly and would be just about empty.

That's exactly how things turned out. I had a row of seats to myself while those on the other train were lucky to get any seat. There are abundant resources available in exchange for assuming some risk.
