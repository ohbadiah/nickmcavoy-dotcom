Many of us living in industrialized countries find that we weigh too much.

It's understandable enough. Many of us spend our workdays sitting down. Our jobs might still be really tiring but they're not using our bodies much. We get from place to place seated as well. Also, calories are really cheap. The cheapest food is chock full of them, and in America anyway it's hard to find even moderately priced food which is both delicious and healthy. So exercise doesn't come naturally, but overeating does. Being overweight comes easily!

Being overweight is really bad. You don't look good. Probably when you get older you'll be stalked by diabetes and heart disease. And think of the children. There's a lot of need, therefore, to help people lose weight! 

Most people who want to lose weight are unsuccessful, at least in the long run. That's because many attempts are unable or unwilling to change the fundamental structure I just observed. Our lives are streams that naturally run toward fatness. Running a weight loss engine against that current takes a lot of energy. Most of us don't have the energy and discipline to maintain such an engine permanently.

Lots of hucksters peddle easy current-reversing engines. The laws of thermodynamics still apply, so these things mostly don't work. No, to reliably and sensibly lose weight requires changing the stream itself.

What that means is there's not really an easy way out. Most people aren't in a position to leave their careers for lives of, say, farming, so let's assume that a potential weight-loser is still going to have a desk job.

You could ditch the car. Driving is killing society and the planet anyway, so you might as well stop it from killing you, too. You probably don't live somewhere that biking is practical, so you might have to move somewhere it is, like Philadelphia. It turns out places you can live without a car are generally great places to live anyway, so you might as well. But not everyone is in a position to just up and move. Most will just opt to be overweight where they are.

For many people it will be more practical to change the eating-fabric of their lives than the doing-fabric. Unfortunately the assumed concept at play here is the fundamentally unsound one of the Diet. A Diet is something you go on for a while, work hard at, and then come off of when you're done losing weight. In other words you plop your engine into the stream, you work really hard at changing the current of the water for a while, and then you turn it off, hoping the water won't flow the same direction it did before.

No, eating to lose weight requires adopting a diet with a lower-case d, a permanent culture of eating that merely satisfies body and soul. The big trick here is that as I mentioned in America you will be hard-pressed to find prepared food meeting these needs. To eat properly you won't be able to eat out much, and shortcut meals at home won't be any better. You're going to have to feed yourself!

Feeding yourself still presents the omnivore's dilemma. What do you eat? Allow me to offer a few principles:

- You should eat good food. You're going through all the work to feed yourself. If you don't enjoy it, why bother?
- Respect the biomass pyramid. Roughly speaking meat is worth 10 times its weight in plants. Eat mostly plants.
- Prioritize nutrient density over calorie density. 
- Pay more for lesser quantities of higher quality. Your body will be happier with less of good than more of mediocre.

These principles feed off of one another! No pun intended. It's going to take more time and some energy and learning, but you'll be glad you did, especially when you start losing weight as a side effect.

As for me, I've been in need of weight loss for most of my life. I suppose that's half of what I need to have some authority on the subject! More recently I have had some success, though I'm not finished yet, nor have I maintained my weight loss for long enough to take much notice.

What's been my secret? I feed myself some using the above principles, but I actually still eat out a lot. I've employed a strategy implied by this framework but that I haven't mentioned yet: I left America! Here in South Korea you are never far from a yummy and healthy restaurant dinner for about $6. It's something to keep in mind.

Time for lunch!
