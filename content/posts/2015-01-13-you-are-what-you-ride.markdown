It's cold outside. Going anywhere requires coming to terms with that.

You don't need to come to terms with it for very long or very severely if you're driving. I can start my car from inside my house and reach it already warm. This possibility shifts the transportation calculus in the wintertime toward driving.

So what? Well, I wish this weren't so, but biking is about the only exercise I get. So if I don't bike through the winter then I don't get any exercise for four months out of the year. Biking through the winter maintains exercise and thus helps [keep me young](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/how-exercise-keeps-us-young/?_r=0).

It matters more than that, though.

The existence of the heated car tells a story about me: it suggests that the cold is really unpleasant and I am not made for moving through it. When I drive I live out that story and it becomes true.

Biking through the cold tells a different story. Biking says that the cold isn't so bad, that I can get used to it. In acting out that story it becomes true. I might have to buy gloves for my gloves because one pair of gloves isn't enough to keep my hands from going numb, but soon I learn that *all* I need is to buy some gloves for my gloves and biking through the winter is no big deal. Adaptations that sound ridiculous to driving-me become reasonable and soon forgotten.

What I am capable of is not apparent to my senses the moment I step outside and realize it is cold. Like the remote-starting heated car, much technology caters to us in these moments. These uses of technology optimize within local minima, giving us "our best lives now" and trapping us within those confines.  But we can also make choices that lead us out of local minima, to not just better experiences but to better selves, to broad new regions we could not have foreseen from our doorsteps.

I don't particularly like the cold, but it is a gift like the proverbial grain of sand to the oyster. And I am glad for tools like bicycles that give me a lifeline to a pattern of conquering.
