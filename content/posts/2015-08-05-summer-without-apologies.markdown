I'm finally embracing what I perceive to be an unpopular opinion. As someone timid around any sort controversy, likely to remain under cover about such things, this is a big step.

The opinion in this case is this: Of the four seasons, summer is by far the best.

I suppose this isn't quite so unpopular as picking winter would be, but it's close. In my experience most people will say fall, or perhaps spring. I like fall and spring too! But summer is better.

Much of the idea of fall and spring is that these seasons impose the least on you. They most resemble the climate-controlled interiors we create for ourselves. Autumn is ready with a hot cup of cider if you would like it, but it doesn't mind if you'd rather just go about your business instead, and meanwhile it will paint a pretty picture for you with the leaves.

This is the same thinking that leads people to pay obscene amounts of money to live someplace where it's springlike year-round, someplace like San Francisco. Summer will have none of that. Summer is in your face. But when you go along for the ride summer is offering, boy does it deliver.

Daylight! Glorious daylight! Sure, it starts creeping in the window awfully early, but the light continues hours even after leaving a long day job. (This is why daylight savings time is totally worth it. Anyone who disagrees can go live in a geodesic dome.)

And the produce! Peaches and tomatoes and herbs and green beans and squash and you-name-it! Many of these things can technically be had year-round due to our global agricultural system. But summer is the only time in the Northeast they can be had fresh and local, and these are more than just buzzwords: they're qualitative differences in taste and therefore almost surely nutrition as well.

So it's hot during the afternoon? May I suggest that you sit in the shade during the afternoon and reserve your activity for the extended morning and evening hours. Or stay indoors!

Thunderstorms. Swimming. Relaxed times at the office. Vacations. Weddings. Less traffic on the road. Arnold Palmers and tall glasses of German wheat beer. And that's just the B reel!

I too appreciate the benefits and comforts of fall and spring. I can even appreciate many aspects of winter. But for this guy in this part of the world, it's all about summer, and the other guys can get in line. I'm no longer ashamed to say it.
