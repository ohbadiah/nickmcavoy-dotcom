I love this bag.

![Taking this picture was possible because of its subject.](/img/my-bag.jpg)

Let me count the ways.

<!-- MORE -->

- Its design is more expressive than anything I've worn.
- It's multimodal and almost modular. A truly modular bag would have to allow you to attach and detach compartments, but this bag has dividers that can be pushed aside, allowing it to be subdivided.
- It has two extremely useful outer pockets, useful because they're big and accessible. The inspiration here is the speed with which video game character Link accesses the treasures in his bag, pulling out a bow or an ocarina at an instant's need. I carry my camera in the outer pocket and that makes it much easier to pull out the camera and take a picture. I should be able to take a lot more pictures.
- It's big enough to hold a lot of stuff, but it's small enough to fit underneath the seat on an airplane, meaning it counts as a "personal item" and there's no need to compete for or pay for overhead bin space.
- Its single strap goes over my right shoulder, leaving my left shoulder free. This is important because it's hard for me to wear anything over my left shoulder.
- It doesn't have any branding, save for a discrete logo of [the company that made it by hand in Philadelphia](http://www.reloadbags.com). I'm nobody's billboard.

A bag seems mundane, but this bag is going to change my life. It's more versatile and useful than a backpack, and I plan to take it most everywhere I go.

My thanks to Roland and the whole crew at R.E.Load Bags!
