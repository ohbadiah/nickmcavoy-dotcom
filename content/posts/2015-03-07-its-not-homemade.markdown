It's a strike against a restaurant if they offer anything homemade.

Homemade means made at home. If you're a restaurant your food had better be made in your kitchen, where you had better not be living. I'm pretty sure health department regulations prohibit that sort of thing.

What is usually meant by such a declaration is that the food was made in the restaurant. Well, congratulations, that's what I thought I was paying you for. When I go to a concert I expect the musicians to be playing their own instruments, too.

Now, not every restaurant can be expected to make absolutely everything they serve in-house. There is some reason to promise and take pride in making certain things in-house. But the proper adjective for such things is, well, housemade.

A menu that claims something is homemade is often trying to cover up for uninspired food by conjuring feelings of nostalgia for mom's kitchen. I take it as a warning sign, a demerit if you will.
