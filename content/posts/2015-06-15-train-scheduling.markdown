Culture is usually so deep you don't normally notice. I noticed an aspect of car culture this morning that I never had before. It's this: the assumption we are the masters of our coming and our going times, down to the minute.

If I know how long it takes me to drive someplace, and I want to get to that place 5 minutes earlier than usual, for the most part I just need to leave 5 minutes earlier. However, if instead I'm subject to the schedule of a train that only departs every half hour, I may need to leave a full half hour earlier, needing also to figure out how best to use the excess 25 minutes at my destination.

If you're me, and you're facing the latter situation, you will often opt to be 5 minutes late.

My workplace is at the nexus of two such train lines. In theory that should attract talent, and it does; I never would have considered working so far from home without the option to take the train. But I'm certain the recent decision to move our morning meeting from 9:30 to 9:15 did not consider that the train arriving at 9:16 would now be a late arrival. 15 minutes earlier is just 15 minutes earlier, right?

It's no big deal; I should be biking the whole way anyway!
