I [wrote](/yhwh/posts/2015/04/16/leviticus-and-slavery) the other day about how Leviticus is a challenging book of the Bible to study. That much was clear to me as I read through it during the week, but something else came together for me when we gathered to discuss it: 

Leviticus may be one of the most important books of the Bible for Christians to study.

Much of what is challenging about Leviticus can be grouped under a single heading: the holiness of God.

### The Holiness of God

What does holiness mean? There is a general idea in the culture which has mostly negative connotations, a mixture between hypocritical judgmentalism and never having fun. I think that's understandable because often those who have sought most to exhibit God's holiness have instead shown these traits. Pastor Choi mentioned in today's sermon that he used to call himself Holy Joe and shamelessly show forth what he thought was the holiness of God but what in restrospect was not at all.

Holiness means something like being set apart or different. That doesn't quite capture it because as Pastor Choi said holiness is like love in that it needs to be demonstrated in order to be really understood. "By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us." By Leviticus we can learn a lot about God's holiness.

### The view from the Tabernacle

Our reaction to reading Leviticus might be that it must have been hard to live with God. There was an awful lot to remember and to do and to pay! The other side of the coin is that it took a lot for God to dwell with his people. This gap is God's holiness. He is not like us, fickle and subjective and frail and shifting and contradictory. He is unchanging and perfect.

God would not merely overlook the failings of his people, precisely because he is holy. One of his attributes does not overrule the others but rather he holds all fully and constantly. His love could not override his justice or else he would be unjust and therefore not God. 

Moreover it is a consistent principle of Scripture that what God commands, he also provides. 

### Making a Way

Much of the ceremony of the Law foreshadows the life and work of Jesus when he came to earth. Holding both Leviticus and the New Testament in one slim volume makes it easy to miss this point, but it is miraculous that this Testimony that was given over a millennium before Christ's life spoke so clearly about it.

That resemblance was much of the point, actually. The Levitical law was meant to keep Israel until Christ's arrival. Every lamb slain pointed to the Lamb who was Slain. In Christ the demands of the Law were completely fulfilled (*not* abolished!).

Jesus's death and resurrection is why we don't have to keep kosher or sacrifice animals or purify ourselves ceremonially. Those were but shadows of his fullness.

### Cheap grace

But here's why Leviticus is so helpful for Christians to study. It is easy for us to lazily think that Jesus's fulfillment is exactly God's love overruling his holiness. We can go to church in jeans and eat God's body and blood because Jesus has gone into the Holy of Holies in heaven and made atonement for us. But it took no less great a sacrifice for this to be possible! If we forget this we are liable to waste our lives, though redeemed they may be.

From as early as I can remember the idea of God as my loving father made sense to me. Someone told me early on that I could pray to Him as such, and so I did. It was quite an adjustment for me to hear around the age of 13 that I was sinful. I honestly couldn't think of anything wrong that I had done. And wasn't God still in my corner? Didn't Dad have my back?

Well, yes, he was, and yes, he did. It was not wrong to tell me as a young boy of God's nearness and benevolence, quite right actually, but it would have been wrong for me to reach adulthood without learning about the price that status cost another man. Years later I grappled with the idea that God's morality might not always be the morality that just flowed from my own mind and experience. Accepting the Judge rather than trying to sit in his seat has been instrumental in the life I have lived and the man I have become.

### One Bible, one God

The most common conception of God as he is revealed in the Bible is that the angry God shows up early on and the loving God shows up later. Many Christians believe this too. Happily this picture is just wrong. The God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament are alike יהוה, perfect and full in holiness and righteousness and truth and love. 

He's not who we would make up. He's not like us. If it were otherwise he would not be real. Leviticus and the epistle to the Hebrews, the New Testament book that best explains it in light of Jesus, usually should not be introductory reading for people coming to know God, for Jesus has indeed brought God as near as if he were not holy. But for Christians seeking to go on to maturity, they are essential study in order to come to know God more fully.

With this fuller picture in mind the Holy Spirit will bring us to exemplify the Levitical command repeated by Jesus and by his apostles: "Be holy, for I am holy." In so doing we may not waste our lives.
