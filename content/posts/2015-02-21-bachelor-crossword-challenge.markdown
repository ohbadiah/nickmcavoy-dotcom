Bachelor party quests age like a fine wine. I learned that on Monday night.

When Josh was getting married we threw him a rather epic bachelor party. After exactly the kind of cookout in the park you might expect for such an affair, we delivered Josh a note from Hannah. She had been kidnapped by Ganondorf and he needed to rescue her!

What followed was an elaborate miniature quest a la the Legend of Zelda that took place on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania. Josh had to find his sword and shield, strike down enemies, play frisbee golf, and more leading up to the final showdown against his three compatriots in Super Smash Brothers all playing against him as Ganondorf projected in a campus auditorium.

But there was one challenge that was too great for that evening, so great that he begged leave to complete it at a later time. I'm referring of course to the crossword puzzle.

We made him a crossword puzzle with over 200 clues. This was supposed to represent the puzzles you need to solve in the course of a Zelda dungeon. The clues were mostly inside jokes or wordplay about our shared history. That it didn't even occur to me that this might take a long time tells you something about me.

Josh's request to defer the challenge was understandable. However, he didn't take it up soon after, not after the honeymoon or the births of his first three children or moving to Arizona for a PhD program.

It had been nearly five years. He thought he could escape. He was wrong.

I'm visiting Josh and his family this week. The first night I was here I insisted that we dig up and complete the crossword, or else his marriage would be null and his children illegitimate. Josh gave in.

As you might expect, a lot had changed in five years. We didn't have hours together every week to spend on games. In fact, we who participated in that party are spread across three time zones now. So it was natural for Josh and me to complete the challenge together, and given the amount of elapsed time it probably wouldn't have been possible otherwise.

The clues had us howling with laughter. Some examples (highlight to reveal the answer!):

- 6 across: Powerthirst's promised progeny <span class="secret">(400)</span>
- 44 across: u wll shr ths plc w yr wf <span class="secret">(br)</span>
- 77 across: In theology, number of Who's in the one What <span class="secret">(three)</span>
- x4 across: Force sufficient to accelerate 10<sup>-18</sup> kg at 1 m/s2  <span class="secret">(an)</span>
- 7 down: Name of Brawl's predecessor, if it used clouds of dust to explain things <span class="secret">(Mele)</span>
- 34 down: You both blow up, but only he dies <span class="secret">(worthit)</span>
- X11 down: Muscle atop the shoulder. Also, Ackbarâ€™s lament. <span class="secret">(trap)</span>

There are 276 of these. Obviously we were a bunch of college-aged guys and we were extreme nerds, but looking beyond that I was surprised how significant the crossword really was. Far better than any photograph could have, it captured the intimacy we shared at that time. Our friendships were a great web of shared knowledge and mirth. It and the memory of the party also captured the love we had for one another. I hardly remember putting all of the work into this event that it must have been, and I can't imagine doing something like that with present constraints, but we did then and it seemed like no trouble.

In a way it was bittersweet to have the quality of our friendship recalled to mind so vividly. After all, we frankly don't enjoy this degree of fellowship anymore. I'm seeing Josh for the first time in over a year and a half. I had the same feelings visiting our companion in arms Ben just before Josh. For one of the first times in my life I felt some truth to the idea that college was the best time of our lives. I yearned for it and wondered if maybe we could all retire to the same place someday.

Yet surely we have not lost our way, but rather gone on to greater things in our manhood. I'm glad for the reminder, though - of what has been, a foretaste of what will be.
