When rethinking an aspect of our cuisine, some foods can be executed much better on our own. Others may not be worth retaining at all. I'm not sure which category ketchup falls into but I lean toward the latter.

Let's say we're interested in rethinking ketchup. We want to understand a few things:

- What *is* it, really?
- What does it do for our cuisine?
- How do current implementations on the market succeed, and how do they fail?
- How could we do better by making our own?

#### What *is* it, really?

Ketchup is a tomato condiment. The versions you buy are pretty simple: concentrated tomatoes, corn syrup, a splash of vinegar, and some unnamed spices.

#### What does it do for our cuisine?

In America anyway ketchup is the "Hello, world!" of condiments, the first kids are introduced to. It goes on hot dogs and the various kinds of fried potato that we seem to consider distinct foods and eggs, too. At its most sophisticated it is an ingredient in the glaze for meatloaf or in barbecue sauce.

Like all condiments, ketchup should aspire to complement or enhance the foods it accompanies.

#### How do current implementations on the market succeed, and how do they fail?

There's a fairly widespread consensus that Heinz makes the best ketchup on the open market. Other brands are even sweeter or syrupier or taste weaker on the tomato front. Heinz definitely comes through with a robust tomatoiness. It's incredibly predictable, providing a homogenous experience from first taste to aftertaste, from first to last portion of a bottle, and from bottle to bottle.

There's a reason it's so successful with kids. The flavor is a simple and one-dimensional sweetness, offering no challenge to their often simpler pallates. It's also very strong. 

My complaint with Heinz as with other ketchups is that it's too sweet and it's thus boring and lazy. It's too strong to play nicely with anything delicate or subtle. Ketchup's favorite partner in crime, the fried potato, is an instructive example. Fried potatoes provide very little aside from saltiness, heat, and oil. Similarly one-dimensional, they are a fitting complement to the cool sweetness of the ketchup, but it's really a cheap thrill that doesn't do anything nutritionally or sensibility-wise.

It works at a low and accessible level, but we can aspire to more.

#### How could we do better by making our own?

It would not be hard to homemake ketchup in large quantities. Start with tomatoes and add heat. Adjust with vinegar and spices as desired. I guess you could add sugar, but I doubt there is anything to be gained by doing so. I'd probably go a little heavier on the vinegar, probably of the apple cider variety, and start with some paprika and salt and maybe garlic.

The question to me is whether ketchup is valuable enough to warrant having in the kitchen at all. There just may not be a place for it if it's at its best accompanying things themselves of questionable worth. Eggs are about the only potential mate that I consider worth keeping in the home, and I'd much rather top eggs with a good tomato salsa. If ketchup is a component in another sauce then the middlesauce can be eliminated; ketchup's components can be used without loss of utility and with gain in clarity and simplicity.

I could see whipping up a batch for a certain occasion, say a french fry fling in the home on a Friday night. I just can't see keeping it around as a regular member of the cast of the kitchen.
