Oxygen is nasty stuff. We don't think it is because we need it to live. But chemically speaking there are lots of similarities between oxygen and chlorine. They both occur as diatomic gases and they're both incredibly electronegative, which means they *really* want to be in a chemical reaction.

But none of us will mistake oxygen's cousin chlorine for something nice. Chlorine gas was a chemical weapon in World War I and has been since relegated to a category of paritcular heinousness. But oxygen had an even worse effect at one time. Ever hear of the [Oxygen Catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event)? That's when cyanobacteria photosynthesis caused oxygen to accumulate in the atmosphere for the first time ever. It caused one of the greatest extinction events in Earth history and for good measure triggered the Huronian glaciation, possibly the worst ice age ever.

So we may need oxygen, but if we think it benign we will make serious mistakes. Like buying pre-shredded cheese.
