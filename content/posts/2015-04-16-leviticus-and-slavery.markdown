title: Leviticus and Slavery

In my church's Wednesday night Bible study we're currently reading through the entire Bible, starting with Genesis and presumably going the distance. This week was the third week and so we read the third book, Leviticus, perhaps the most infamous book in the whole library we call the Bible.

Leviticus details the giving of the Law, the constitution by which Israel was to be a nation whose God was the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. The thing is, the character of the Law does not always follow from what we intuitively believe to be character befitting of God. There's an awful lot of blood involved, what with all of the animal sacrifice. Restrictions in the face of leprosy or even menstruation seem harsh. And certain practices we find abhorrent are permitted if not actively endorsed.

Chief among the latter is slavery. Shouldn't it have been prohibited outright? I tend to think so. But it's not, and that's an obstacle to viewing the Law in the same light as does the Psalmist:

<pre class="prose">
The law of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is perfect,
reviving the soul;
The testimony of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is sure,
making wise the simple; 
The precepts of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> are right,
rejoicing the heart;
The commandment of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is pure,
enlightening the eyes;
The fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is clean,
enduring forever;
The rules of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> are true,
and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold,
even much fine gold;
sweeter also than honey
and drippings of the honeycomb.

Psalm 19:7-9
</pre>

Indeed, I think even the translators of the ESV get squeamish about it.

Check out their translation of chapter 25:

<pre class="prose">
If your brother becomes poor beside you and sells himself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave: he shall be with you as a hired servant and as a sojourner. He shall serve with you until the year of jubilee. Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and go back to his own clan and return to the possession of his fathers. For they are my servants,<sup>1</sup> whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves. You shall not rule over him ruthlessly but shall fear your God.

<sup>1</sup> Hebrew <i>slaves</i>
</pre>

Do you see that? Israel are all God's servants,<sup>1</sup> where we're told "well, actually the word used there is slaves. But really, it means servants!" To be fair, the ESV is far from the only translation to make this choice. I don't know Hebrew so I don't know what else may lie behind the translation. But what it *looks* like is that the Hebrew says that the Israelites are God's slaves, but because that idea is so offensive a less offensive word was used instead.

I noticed this because *slaves* actually seems to make more sense in the passage. It's a rule against enslaving Israelites. If they can't be enslaved because they are already slaves to God that makes perfect logical sense, more cleanly than simple servanthood. Again, I'm speaking way out of my field of expertise here so I don't want to imply this is what happened, but it would be a shame to dilute the meaning of the text and actually obscure its meaning just because we can't handle the truth.

In fact, I wonder if Israel's enslavement to God might actually be the key to understanding slavery's presence in Leviticus. Get a whiff of what God intended for Israel as a consequence of its servitude:

<pre class="prose">
"If you walk in my statutues and observe my commandments and do them, then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. Your threshing shall last to the time of the grape harvest, and the grape harvest shall last to the time for sowing. And you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land securely. I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid. And I will remove harmful beasts from the land, and the sword shall not go through your land. You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand, and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. I will turn to you and make you fruitful and multiply you and will confirm my covenant with you. You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall clear out the old to make way for the new. I will make my dwelling among you, and my soul shall not abhor you. And I will walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be my people. I am the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves. And I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect."

Leviticus 26:3-13
</pre>

So in return for his people's faithful obedience, God would shower them with blessing and dwell with them. An Israelite who paid this treatment forward to his slave might soon have not a slave but a brother before him. That thought makes Leviticus's toleration of slavery a little easier to bear.
