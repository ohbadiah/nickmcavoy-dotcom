On balance, it's better to be able to communicate with anyone. But there are certain advantages to not being able to.

You can strike an interesting balance as an English speaker in Korea. Things like the transportation system are offered in English as well as in Korean, so you don't need much Korean to function in daily life. Also, in my case the people I was closest to all spoke fluent English. As it turns out, many of the remaining scenarios for communication are not desirable anyway.

Merely being able to communicate with a man is to have some power over him. Just look at advertising, the lucrative art of manipulating people by foisting language (and images) upon them. For those situations in which an ad blocker is not possible, the next best defense is being unable to understand the ad!

It's also a stellar defense against those who ignore normal rules of decorum in order to recruit for their cause. You can walk past the Greenpeace table almost with impunity if the volunteers don't think they can talk with you!

My grandfather has talked about the peaceful world he can retreat into whenever he desires to by virtue of being hard of hearing. He simply removes his hearing aids, and *voila*, peace and quiet!

If not quickly then eventually one tires of not being able to communicate. But learning a language is not without its tradeoffs.
