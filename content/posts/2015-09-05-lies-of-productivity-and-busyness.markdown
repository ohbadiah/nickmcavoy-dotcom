Yesterday was my second last day at a job. I'd left before, then came back for another brief tour of duty this summer. After those months, I'm back where I was before: committed to working half time for another, remote job that should be enough to pay the bills.

Already I feel like my humanity has been restored. The job itself was rather stressful, but I think it was chiefly the schedule of working full days and commuting an hour each way that led me to inhumane tendencies. It's worth reflecting on and enumerating a couple of tendencies I encountered today and was relieved to reject, at least for a moment.

Chief among these lies is that you are what you get done. I paused for a moment after leaving the tea shop and packing my purchases into my messenger bag. After standing there for really a couple of minutes getting readjusted and taking in the day, I realized I hadn't remembered to unlock my bike and the adjustment process would need to be repeated. In that moment, despite the inconsequentiality of the mistake, I felt the threat of fear and shame. If I couldn't quickly get going with my bike, how would I complete the many needful labors in my life?

In the unspoken cult of productivity, efficiency is king. A lapse in mobilizing your transportation is as bad as any other kind of lapse.

Like a ray of sunshine I remembered that it doesn't matter if I take another minute to get going, that focusing on productivity as an end in itself is a sure way to get all of the wrong things done.

In just a few moments I walked toward Walnut Street as the light was green. A man with two canes was slowly walking toward me. I clenched in fear for a moment, realizing that if I waited for the man to pass that I would probably miss the light. If the light changed, my day might as well be over. How would I make it to everything needful? 

Then I remembered that traffic lights are only red for an utterly inconsequential amount of time, and I did not need to knock the man over in order to fulfill what was required of me.

As you can see, I've been in pretty deep. This decompression is going to be glorious.
