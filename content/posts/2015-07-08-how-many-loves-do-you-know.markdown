C.S. Lewis wrote a book called *The Four Loves*. The idea, not so clear in English but realized in languages like Greek through different words for different loves, is that there are different kinds of love. Roughly, you might speak of *agape*, the unconditional love God has for his people; of *storge*, basic familial love; of *eros*, romantic love; or of *philia*, brotherly love.

Despite our fair city taking its name from *philia*, I have often felt that our society knows little of it. I have known this love, and I have read about it in ancient accounts in the likes of Augustine's *Confessions*, but I encounter only the most stunted charicature in contemporary culture. Indeed, Lewis felt the same in his day, saying, "to the Ancients, Friendship seemed the happiest and most fully human of all loves; the crown of life and the school of virtue. The modern world, in comparison, ignores it."

Instead we magnify *eros* and subsume *philia* into it. It's impossible to speak of "two men who love each other" without connoting eros. Men have long been hesitant to let the riches of *philia* bloom for fear of being perceived as loving one another erotically. This confusion is not allayed by our society's recent acceptance of homoerotic love, though the symptoms of the problem are different. Without understanding *philia* we will still mislabel it and miss the chance to experience its fullness.

I encountered this change yesterday at a food truck.

Me and Zach love each other. One thing that's been great about our friendship is we have never been inhibited by any fear of *eros* being inferred from our *philia*. That's freed us to share beds as readily as candy bars. We weren't anxious about whether we were gay or whether anyone else thought we were. If they did, who cares what other people think? Maybe they could see in us what was possible for them.

Yesterday he picked me up from the train station and we went to a food truck. Right as we got to the front of the line I realized we hadn't really said hello to one another. "Give me a hug!" I said, and right as the food truck operator asked for our order that's what we did.

For perhaps the first time, I felt self-consious about displaying affection for him. Zach felt it too, and more than a couple of people's attention was drawn. Then we placed our order.

"I'm just so excited about the Supreme Court's ruling," I said to him. "I'm even wearing my rainbow tie dye." I didn't know how else to cut the tension. Then we moved on.
