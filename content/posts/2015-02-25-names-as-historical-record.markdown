title: Names as Historical Record

Names tell you a lot about a place. I've noticed that the last few weeks as I've traveled in Phoenix and San Francisco and compared those names to my home in Pennsylvania.

It's really helpful if a city's streets adhere to an easily discerned scheme so that the name of any one street tells you something about where you are. Numbering all streets going a certain direction is the most obvious scheme.

Phoenix employs numbering to the extreme. East of the city center are streets numbered starting at 1 and west of the city center are avenues also numbered starting at 1. The scheme continues right on past Phoenix and into neighboring municipalities such that my grandparents live on 164th avenue 30 miles away in Goodyear. That scheme tells you about Phoenix. No place that wasn't so flat and so regular and so recent could accomodate such uniformity so far.

Aside from such expansive uniformity, in Phoenix I noticed more than a few names that were bland, redundant, or ignorant. Bland: the Agua Fria River. I imagine someone happening upon a river and  exclaiming "This water's cold!" and putting no more thought into it.  Redundant: Table Mesa, literally the table table or the mesa mesa. Ignorant: places named for Montezuma even though no Aztecs lived in Arizona.

Collectively these names tell a story that isn't very long or eventful or considered. That's not primarily the fault of present Arizonans, but there it is. Among natural formations that convey the age of the earth better than anything I've encountered, a civilization has grown up in the desert in less time than you can hold your breath. 

The streets in San Francisco's Sunset district and surrounding environs are a good example of how to be both intelligible and rooted.

Numbered avenues run north and south. East and west run alphabetically named streets. So seeing a sign for Noriega gives you an echo of the past as well as an idea of how far to go if your destination is on Taraval. Coasting down 19th Avenue yesterday I took pleasure in calling these streets to mind one by one. When I remembered that after Rivera came not Sloat yet but first Santiago, I was reminded of my own history in this place as well as its uniqueness.

Philadelphia has numbered streets running north and south while east-west streets don't follow much of a scheme. Those closest to Market are named for trees, presumably the trees that were once planted along them. Far into the south are such quixotic names as Earp (for the cowboy?) and Oregon and Tasker. Further, not every name in Pennsylvania was given by European settlers. Rather than naming something on very short acquaintance, I rather appreciate rivers that still bear Native American names like Monongahela, Allegheny, and Susquehanna.

In short, the quality of names tells a story about a place that affects the life of that place. In San Francisco and Philadlephia many layers of history interleave and beg the occupant to learn and understand. As Phoenix's history continues and it develops increasingly distinct culture and history, I think it would do well to give new (or old!) names to things in need of them.
