My friend Matt and his band [Rosetta](http://rosettaband.com) don't need a record label. They used to have one and they got rid of it.

I guess a label is supposed to front you a lot of capital and bear a lot of the risk of a creative enterprise. Maybe they pay for studio space and whatnot to produce an album and then they produce and distribute the physical media and promote your tour and so forth. If you do well then they recoup their investment and then some. If you don't do well then they're out the investment they sunk into you.

The thing is the Internet and other improvements in computing technology mean there is a lot less capital required to get an album off the ground, and publicity is likewise pretty easy and cheap. Labels are unnecessary. For Rosetta's latest album, *The Anaesthete*, they invested more money into the production of the album than their label ever had. The first day the album was released they recouped their investment, and every sale has been gravy from that point onward.

There's a crucial link in the chain though that makes self-publishing possible: a fair distribution platform. That's what [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com) is, and that's why it earns a Nick McAvoy Gold Star of the Internet award, which I just invented.

Everybody gets a square deal with Bandcamp. Artists get to set up shop for free. Bandcamp takes a 10-15% cut of sales, in other words a fair share commensurate with the service they provide. Fans get a really good deal, too. When you buy an album you download it in whatever format you prefer, including lossless if like me you care about that sort of thing. Then it's yours. No DRM. No "license to play the album whenever you're connected to our server feeding our machine learning about what to sell you next and consuming our advertisements." You bought it, you own it, and physical album purchases come with digital downloads as well. It's exactly the kind of service the Internet *should* bring into existence.

I'll tell you what though, you won't find *The Anaesthete* streaming on Spotify. Spotify is a good deal for everyone involved except artists. A label makes money for selling in aggregate all of its property. Spotify gets lots of money from advertising and subscription fees. Users get to play tons of music on demand for a pittance. Payouts to individual artists are negligible, unless you're one of the very few at the very top of the charts. 

It's interesting that from the artist's perspective services like Spotify are indistinguishable from piracy. Either way someone is listening to their music without having paid for it. The difference is there are a few entities in between profiting from the exchange. For users the difference is a small risk of legal ramifications is substituted with listening to occasional ads or paying a blanket pittance for all music.

So why hasn't Bandcamp taken over? It's the solution to the music+Internet equation, but I think Spotify makes more in a month than Bandcamp has ever. I can think of a couple of reasons.

First, there are a lot of interests vested in the status quo. Middlemen want to stay in the middle. In order to do so they will build and advertise mechanisms really convenient for the end user, and since they start the game with a lot of resources they can build really nice services.

Second, many people don't listen to music intentionally. To many music is not worthy of focused critical attention, an end in itself, but a means to other ends like working out or dancing or doing chores. I've written about this [before](/muse/posts/2014/07/17/on-a-diet/). This understanding of music involves listening in such quantities that paying a fair price for all of it would actually become rather costly. Moreover it works against awareness of particular artists and corresponding desire that they be fairly rewarded for their labor.

Thinking about these ethical and technological dynamics led me to cancel my Spotify subscription, and it's the same reasoning that has prevented me from buying a Kindle. It's great that Amazon went to all the trouble to build a good way to read electronic books. I would happily reward them for their effort by purchasing the device. But Amazon is seeking to provide more than just the device for reading; they want to also be the marketplace for ebooks, and the marketplace they have built is skewed in all of the same ways the music marketplace is. So I won't use it; I buy books from a local used bookstore and am very satisfied with that arrangement.

Some pushback by authors against Amazon is getting some attention, and that's good. However, nothing I have seen addresses the point that Amazon's marketplace is fundamentally unnecessary. I'm sure it is the most popular and viable one at present, but that's mostly because of all the work they have done to privilege and promote it. Authors and consumers who really want the promise of the Internet to be realized should invest in a fairer platform, like [leanpub](https://leanpub.com/).

Al Gore promised us a better Internet than this. The Internet was supposed to break down barriers between people, allowing the likes of authors and their readers to exchange directly with one another. It's heartening that platforms like Bandcamp do exist, but it's frustrating that they are sideshows compared to still-powerful relics of the recent past. I wonder if this will change going forward, or if technology's progress will continue to produce dehumanized consumption patterns such as come naturally with Spotify.
