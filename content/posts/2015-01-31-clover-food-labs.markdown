I was in Boston for [a conference](http://nescala.org) today. There were lots of opportunities, but likely more important to me than to other attendees were opportunities for lunch!

In particular I wanted to try to find a food truck because you can often count on food trucks to be innovative and efficient. What was really a white whale was a food truck I vaguely remembered reading about years ago that was started by a materials science student at MIT. I remembered that it was vegetarian and applied the mentality of materials science engineering to the food. It sounded really cool!

I couldn't remember what it was called, but the Internet did its job. I searched for "Boston food trucks" and turned up a list someone made on Yelp. I recognized [Clover Food Lab](http://www.cloverfoodlab.com) and found their web site. Evidently they've done very well because they now had on the order of ten locations, some of them brick and mortar and some of them trucks.

But would there be one within walking distance, or would I be left out in the cold?

As it turns out, there's one in Dewey Square, just a short way back toward the train! I was soon at the square, snowdecahedra and all.

Sure enough, there was the Clover truck. What's more, there were other trucks there too, both of which looked interesting: Mei Mei somehow seemed to be German and Korean, while Bon Me offered up, well, bahn mi that sounded legitimate.

I was not about to merely order food and walk away. Heck, I was going to be lucky if I only ate one lunch. I made sure to talk up the staff at Clover, asking about their history and what was good and testing their patience and  multitasking ability. I settled on a sandwich called the Pushpin.

Overall I was pleased. It had tofu and some kind of ravishing jalapeño relish (materials science clearly on display here!) and chickpeas and some pickled red cabbage. It was exactly as original I expected, which is to say an appealing take on a lunch that tastes good and is good for you and is good for the world and is reasonably priced ($5). I'm not wild about pitas unless they're fresh out of a serious oven, and as a bread baker and lover I thought "sandwich" verged on misnomer here, but it was definitely passable and made sense as a pita. The jalapeños gave it the zing I crave.

Filled with a sense of triumph at my successful errand, I resolved not to let those other trucks get away. [Bon Me](http://www.bonmetruck.com) called to me with its miso-braised pulled pork and pickled vegetables (man, remind me that pickling is underrated). Very soon I was holding a very crispy toasted baguette with loads of quality pork. Again, baking for myself has kind of ruined me for most bread out there; the baguette wasn't bad but it seemed to be all gluten and a little dry. The pickled veggies counterbalanced that ably, however, and it was overall a very good sandwich and the best second lunch I had eaten in some time.

By then I was getting cold and it was about time to head back, so I restrained myself to merely two lunches and headed back on the lovely misty grey and blue walk across the Fort Point Channel, triumphant as Paul Revere or someone.
