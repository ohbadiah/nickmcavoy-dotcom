A recurring motif in dreams in which my father appears is that I embrace him.

The embrace is one part joy at having him wth me again and one part fear of losing him again.

Ten years after his death I am glad that I still have these dreams. These emotions ought not be buried beneath forgetfulness. And the dreams remind me to pray that they come true.
