It's been over five years now since I got on a plane to leave Korea when the last thing I wanted to do was leave Korea. The night before I had been out for ice cream with several of the new friends I had made so quickly during my six weeks in Seoul. Suddenly I found myself looking down on the Han River from five miles up, then Japan, then the rising of the sun many hours before my body knew the sunrise was supposed to happen. I did not want to leave. On the contrary it felt like I was just getting started. I made known my hope to return in "one year or two." But leaving was necessary.

"One year or two" passed three years ago, but now belatedly I am on my way back. I write from five miles up once more on the flight away from Philadelphia, the first leg toward Seoul once more.

Now seems like a good a time to reflect on the meaning of the last five years.

### Dusting off the old brain

My first Korea trip came after a year as a science teacher, my first job out of college. I decided not to return for a second year principally because the kind of creativity required to birth "aha!" moments in my students was not the kind of creativity that my heart burned to pursue. Rather I missed applying my mind to more conventionally hard problems like those I faced as a physics student. I coined this longing as the desire to "dust off the old brain," which had really been in disuse for years because of my poor study habits.

As it turns out a knack for programming in physics classes translated into a nascent and then budding career as a software engineer. First I learned Perl, then I started taking master's courses, then I got a job with a tech startup. I was introduced to the basics and functional programming and resilience and iteration. I learned about security and privacy and freedom and the tendency of technology to enslave if unchallenged and its potential to set free if harnessed.

It's been pretty good. Now I have just about come of age as a programmer, but exactly what I will make of this trade very much remains to be seen.

### Falling off the wagon at City Church

When I took that flight back to San Francisco from Seoul I had never drunk an alcoholic beverage. The abuse of peers in high school and college only served to amplify my natural aversion to the influence of substance. I had no plans to start drinking, either.

In the subsequent months I followed the leading of the Lord toward liturgy and tradition and sacrament and I started going to City Church, a relatively new church in West Philly with faces some familiar and others quickly becoming so. This was and remains a church whose approach to a life of worship filled me with deep joy in many facets of life.

Somehow the church's approach to alcohol symbolizes all of these gifts to me. The people of City Church are always drinking and yet never drunk. There we synthesize the command "Do not be drunk with wine, which is dissipation, but be filled with the Holy Spirit" with the teaching that God has given wine "to gladden the heart of man." In the superposition of these verses is found the freedom of the Christian man not from law but to righteousness and the mirth of the coming Kingdom. It was not long at church before I first imbibed, and the gateway to life lived in the world yet not of it, of life not above matter but celebrating and elevating it, was opened to me.

I hope to bring the gift of brewing delicious beer to Korea, or at least everything that has come with it to me.

### Battered

Five years ago the most I had known of suffering and death were the suffering and death of my father, who succumbed to multiple myeloma in 2003. Now three crashes, five broken bones, and two stays in the hospital later I have taken my own excursions toward the death that awaits me. While I am not crushed I am certainly worse for the wear.

I have learned that healing this side of the grave is not always total. Usually some memorial of the injury remains. Head and shoulder, knee and toe I still bear the attenuated marks and hurts of this season. In certain ways I have been aged beyond my years, and these descents are among the great sorrows of my still-young life.

Yet mingled with sorrow have doubtless been many gifts, not least an increase of wisdom. "So teach us to number our days, so that we may gain a heart of wisdom." Thank you, God, for the joys I would not have known but for this grief.

I'm hoping that these sojourns can help spur me to harness the youth that remains in me to attain a better use of my body than I have yet achieved.

### Philadelphia my home

In college we stood against the cultural winds that would have preferred we seek jobs in New York or beyond to the neglect of the friendships we had formed and the place in which we had formed them. Five years in Philadelphia later, I am convinced of the wisdom of holding on to one another by putting down roots here. Even while many of us have been unable to resist opportunities outside Philadelphia, living with assumed fidelity and memory rather than freedom and forgetfulness continues to bear fruit.

Leaving Philadelphia was the much harder because of how I have invested in it. Even as I journey back to Korea I promise to return to what I have planted, in the hopes that it will not be overgrown by time and neglect.
