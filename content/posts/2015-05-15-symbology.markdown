I should start by saying this is a blog, and true to the form I'm writing about something about which I know barely the first. Please feel free to enlighten me in the comments.<span class="until-comments"><sup>1</sup></span>

In the last couple of years I've wanted to up my game with regard to my self-presentation. For most of my life I've tried to say as little as possible with my dress and so forth, nothing beyond "decent fellow I suppose. Seems trustworthy." Lately I wonder if I can do better.

It strikes me that there's an entire dimension available in symbology, "the art of expression by symbols." By displaying symbols I stand for I can make myself known to those with eyes to see.

I got a haircut yesterday and two symbols I've recently taken up came into the picture:

![No, not the bra hanging there.](/img/symbology.jpg)

The first is the symbol of Pentecost on [my bag](/nick/posts/2015/02/11/love-this-bag/) in the background. The second is the Tree of Gondor on the shirt that [my friend Hannah](https://makingrivendell.blogspot.com) decorated and gave me on my most recent swing through the desert.

Yet so far I find a curious difficulty in self-expression through symbology. That's because the medium has been under constant siege for as long as any of us has been alive.

I'm speaking of course about advertising. Symbology must be powerful because companies spend a lot of money devising symbols for themselves, making these symbols known, and associating them with desirable qualities.

From these symbols we're under constant bombardment. The bombardment is quite successful, to the point that the most any of us engage in the same kind of expression is to decorate ourselves with symbols of companies whose symbols are associated with qualities we want to associate with us. Calvin Klein is associated with a certain well-to-do cleanness and by wearing my sweater with their logo on my breast I can convey that same well-to-do cleanness about myself.

(I think this appropriation, by the way, is a far more accurate model of how advertising works and why it's worth so much money than the idea that in order to work ads must convince us rationally of their irrational and ridiculous claims. People see no problem being exposed to ads because they think if we aren't rationally swayed by ads then we aren't being manipulated by them. But if I'm right then we do well to count the cost of exposure.)

The result is that observers think the symbols I've chosen to adorn myself with are derived from this same indirect arena of advertising and brand loyalty rather than being directly of my choosing. Maybe it looks like I'm investing in some hipster brand in an attempt to convey originality, which I suppose isn't so very far from the truth, but virtually no one realizes there's no brand, no corporate or monetary interest being represented at all. The cacophany of the advertisers drowns out my subtle speech, or so I'd like to think.

There is one exception to this void, one way that people do commonly express themselves through symbology: tattoos. I'm thinking of my friend Zach's Papua New Guinea bird of paradise on his right shoulder that is your first clue he's not just another white guy from Minnesota. Now the thing about tattoos is they are usually discreet; you wouldn't see Zach's bird unless his torso manfully burst out of his tank while he was sparring or something like that. The nice thing about symbology through apparel is the symbols are quite public and easy to rotate in different situations or as ideologies develop. Personally I wouldn't get a tattoo as a simple matter of conscience, but I think when done well this is much the sort of expression I'd hope to see.

I'm just getting started employing symbology. As I go along I hope I get better at it.
