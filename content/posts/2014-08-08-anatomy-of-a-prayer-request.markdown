I'm funny about praying for things.

I know if I leave at 9:02 I should have no problem making the 9:32 train out of Overbrook. Today I left at 9:08.

The first decision is whether or not to pray to make the train. Reasons to pray:

- Maybe the prayer is the difference between making and missing the train, i.e. God will answer the prayer.
- God invites his children to pray to him for guidance, provision, and encouragement in all matters great and small.

Reasons not to pray:

<!-- MORE -->

- Praying about something objective is a little scary. It's easier to rationalize God's presence in subjective or long-term matters.
- I realized that when God does answer such prayers it does not encourage me as it should and I do not give thanks to him as I should. Not praying eliminates ungraciousness, right?
- Praying for something so minor, especially related to a habitual struggle, brings to light the inadequacies of my prayer life. Surely there are greater things I ought to pray for, or more righteous, but here I am preoccupied about something mostly inconsequential.

I decided to pray as I set out on my bike. I rode as well as I could, but not as a desperate man fleeing for his life. I resigned myself to making it or not, praying further that I would give proper thanksgiving whether I made it or not. While my limbs were sluggish when I began, by the end of the ride I felt strong. What seemed rather a long shot when I started seemed more feasible as I approached.

I got to the platform, locked my bike with all haste, and hurried to the other side of the tracks. The train arrived a minute later.

Thanks to God who answers prayer even to ungrateful, slow-learning children!
