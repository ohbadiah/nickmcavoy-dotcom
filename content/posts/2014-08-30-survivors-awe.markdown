### The setup

Last Thursday evening, August 21, my teammate Paul Santa Clara gave a talk about the Rust language at [Philly Lambda](http://www.meetup.com/Philly-Lambda/), a local emerging computer languages and technology meetup. I had been bothering Paul to give this talk for a year, I was really stoked it was happening, and most of my team went with me to cheer him on.

My normal workday routine is to bike from my house 4 miles to Overbrook Train Station on the R5 Regional Rail line. I would take the train the other 8 miles from there to work in Radnor and reverse the process in the evening. I followed that script in the morning last Thursday, but Paul's talk was in Center City and I wanted to get better grub than the gruel-pizza that is standard fare at tech meetups, so I took the train straight to Suburban Station in the evening, bypassing my bike in Overbrook.

After Paul's talk, we all went to Monk's Cafe, because where else can you have Pliny the Elder and Delirium Tremons on draft on a normal weeknight? I left Monk's around 10:00 with my teammate and friend Josh, who gave me a ride back to Overbrook and my bicycle. Following my normal routine, I unlocked the bike, set up my front and rear lights, set my pannier on the cargo rack, and set off for home. 

A block away from the station I realized that my helmet was a little loose. I stopped to adjust it and continued on my way. I reflected for a moment on how infinitesmal the likelihood was that this gesture was of any consequence. The chances I was in any incident on my way home were small, and the chances the tighter helmet would make a difference even in such a scenario also seemed unlikely.

That may have been true, but boy was I right to have made the adjustment. That thought is the last thing I remember from that night.

### The damage

My next memories are not from Thursday night but from Friday morning. I was in the hospital and I needed to let people know what had happened to me. My phone was just about dead when I left the train station and it wasn't on me in the hospital, so I could only call people whose numbers I remembered. That meant my mom and my boss, whose number I frequently enter when playing with our platform at Relay.

I was in a serious bike accident a year ago. A driver did not see me, nor did he signal his turn as he turned left at an intersection right into me. I had a tibial plateau fracture and broke my collarbone as well and was in a wheelchair for a couple of months and it was a couple more before I was walking again. I felt so terrible as I was calling my mom again, giving her the phone call from the hospital that every parent dreads. But that is the position I was in.

The news, however, was remarkably good. My injuries were numerous, but none would end up requiring surgery. I fractured my C1 vertebra, also called the [atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_%28anatomy%29), the topmost vertebra on the cervical spine, which is the part of the spine that extends into your neck. Basically, it's the bone you nod with. I also had a few fractures of the orbital bones in my face in front of my sinuses. In addition I had a concussion, a bruised spleen, and two small brain bleeds. Finally, there were abrasions all up my left side, from my flip-flopped foot to my knee, shoulder, and much of my face.

### I could be dead.

This part took about a week to sink in for me, but it could have very easily been much worse. If my atlas was broken worse or differently it could have left me paralyzed or dead. If those hemorrhages were worse it's hard for me to even say what things would be like, but it seems safe to say that "I" would not still be "me." And a bruised spleen is not too far from a ruptured spleen, an injury that could easily lead someone to bleed out and die.

But I didn't know that. I had and still have no memory of the incident itself. I didn't even really understand the degree to which my concussion was affecting my interactions with my visitors, who have reported me repeating things or falling asleep in the middle of sentences for the first couple of days in the hospital. In a sense my frame of reference was the best one to view the injuries with, since I couldn't even see my swollen face in all of its Harvey Dent grotesque.

### I am alive.

By Sunday my memories started becoming more normal, less episodic and dreamlike than memories from Friday and Saturday. An MRI verified that my atlas fracture was not dangerous and my collar was removed. Sunday night my pastor led a small group of us in an abbreviated worship service in my hospital room, complete with a short homily and the full sharing of the Lord's Supper, right down to the singing of the Sanctus. The Lord truly brought his body to me when I was unable to bring myself to worship earlier in the day. 

On Monday I started really gunning for my discharge. Knowing a lot of that hinged on a cognitive assessment from an occupational therapist, I went into that test with all of the faculties developed from decades on the achievement hamster wheel primed for action. "Well, that's the first 30 out of 30 I've ever given on this assessment!" the therapist exclaimed, and just hours later I was on my way home with my mom.

I looked forward to rest at my mom's house, and indeed I spent on the order of 16-18 hours per day there sleeping and recovering this past week. Just yesterday I had a checkup with trauma doctors back here in the city. Since I was feeling well enough, I just moved back into my house here after the checkup.

### Survivors' Awe

It was strange yesterday to suddenly have a more normal energy level. By the time my mom left me, despite all of the events of the day I only napped for half an hour before finding myself awake with an entire evening before me. I sort of shrugged and went to a game night I had been planning on attending before the accident.

That was strange. Normally when we think about the preciousness of life we are occupied with life's highlights: meadows at sunrise, marriage vows at the altar, fine food and drink, and so forth. But at the same time it was hitting home to me just how close to death I had been, I found myself not at a mountaintop moment but at a normal Friday night social gathering with lots of strangers making small talk. It was almost mundane! And it is that contrast, the contrast between how precious we know life really is and how dearly we hold to our lives on the one hand and the silliness and ordinariness of most of life on the other hand, that really blew my mind.

People would ask me how I was, and I would say things like "I'm alive!" or "I shouldn't be here!"

### Praising God

What else am I left to do? I am a Christian, so I do not see merely a series of unlikely events that happen to leave me mostly unharmed. Furthermore I am likely the victim of a crime that will never be pursued let alone solved, though knowing what I do of the vastness of the sea of injustice frees me from obsessing about that. 

In short, I believe I am alive and well because God preserved my life! Yet his purposes are inscrutable. I do not believe I was spared because of any merit on my part; he would be worthy of praise even if I perished that night. No, I do not think it is for me to know why I find my life course little altered by my fall. But I am very grateful to the God who is sovereign over all dangers and who would not allow any to leave a lasting mark!

I do know that from the morning after my accident onward there were lots of people praying for me. Surely the speed and completeness of my recovery are partly because of these petitions. Praise to the God who begs his children to ask him for their desires and who delights in giving what they ask!

Here's hoping that with the breath that has been returned to me I can render proper service and proper praise!

Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears us up; God is our salvation.
Our God is a God of salvation, and to God, the Lord, belong deliverances from death.

Amen.
