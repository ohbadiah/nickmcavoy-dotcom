I'm visiting my friend Jon Kreamer this weekend in Washington D.C. I have a car but cars are destroying the world and cars are expensive. I therefore plan to sell my car and am experimenting with living without it. So instead of driving down I'm taking the bus.

<!-- MORE -->

The idea is that I save about $30 plus whatever wear on my car the drive would be, and instead of devoting my time to driving I can read and think and write blog posts. That's all good as far as it goes, but the benefit is tempered by the general bummer that riding the bus in America is. I haven't spent a ton of time abroad, but I can think of bus trips in Scotland, Ireland, and Korea that were all much more comfortable and enjoyable than riding the bus here is. I'm not sure exactly what makes riding the bus here a bummer, but those other buses definitely gave you more room and a comfier seat, and I don't think their engines were as loud as the constant drone of this one is.  Much like when flying on one of our airlines, I mostly just feel like cargo.

As a result I think you need a pretty strong ideological commitment against driving such as mine in order to prefer this experience, which is a shame. I'd gladly shell out a little more to take the train, but that costs two to four times as much as the bus. 

None of these complaints are a big deal. The world isn't perfect and there are much bigger fish to fry. But please indulge me as I daydream some improvements to the situation:

- comfy, fun buses like in the UK or Korea (Heck, Megabus operates over there too so they should know how.)
- more subsidies for Amtrak. (Megabus doesn't have the exclusive burden of maintaining the highway, but Amtrak has to maintain its rails).
- a service for organizing carpools with strangers (Providing trust and safety would be the challenge here.)
- getting fit enough to bike 130 miles (It's just an order of magnitude more than I bike now, which with training isn't as crazy as it sounds.) 
- taking a horse (Okay, there's a little more infrastructure and culture change required here. But I am daydreaming. And crazy.)
