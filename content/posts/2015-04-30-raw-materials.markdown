I crave simplicity. But it's a different kind of simplicity than sells well.

What's simpler, Bisquick or flour? If you want to make pancakes you have fewer steps to go from Bisquick. With flour you still need to add baking soda and salt and milk and eggs and oil and a bit of sugar. With Bisquick you just need milk and eggs. Bisquick is much simpler, right?

Let's say you want to make a yeasted bread. Or chocolate chip cookies. Or dumpling skins. You'll use flour for those, too. But the Bisquick isn't any good, or at least there aren't fewer steps to go from Bisquick to those things.

That's why rather than having one thing on my shelf, Bisquick, I'd much rather have the five or so things of which it is composed. To me the marginal gain in efficiency when making quick breads is in no way worth the sacrifice in cooking possibilities.

The same impulse extends to kitchen equipment, and indeed out of the kitchen into my work in software and other areas. One of my main influences in the kitchen, Alton Brown, expresses this as one of his trademark rules. Brown says there are no unitaskers allowed in his kitchen. If a tool is only good for one task, then it's not worth its space in the cupboard. Something called a "melon baller" may be really good at reducing a big melon to little bitesite pieces, but it had better be good for something else too to justify its existence in Brown's kitchen.

I recently bought a fancy blender. I had a few specific applications in mind but the real reason I couldn't resist shelling out for it was I foresaw that the power it got me would expand my capabilities in ways beyond what I could imagine. Soon after that I ordered 12 pint-size mason jars, the primary idea being to make jam but also with the idea that even if I didn't make jam the jars were likely to make themselves useful.

I was so pleased, then, to discover while strolling through the Bangsan Baker's Market a purveyor of bulk nuts, including raw peanuts. Finished jars of peanut butter are way simpler to eat than raw peanuts, right? The thing is, peanut butter isn't a staple to anybody in Korea but me. I could pay $20 for a small jar of higher quality peanut butter (but I wouldn't), or I could lower my standards and pay still-too-much for Skippy PB (but I wouldn't), or I could learn to get by without this staple in my diet (but I haven't). Instead I had previously imported 8 jars from the U.S. at a reasonable price.

But with this discovery I had everything necessary to have all the peanut butter I wanted for cheap and without the annoyance of importing. With the peanuts and my blender and my mason jars I can create peanut butter as it has scarcely been known in this nation. Thanks for [the recipe](http://altonbrown.com/wok-fried-peanut-butter/), Alton Brown!

Koreans must use raw peanuts for something. Who knows what. By being oriented toward raw materials I am able to bend them to my aims and have what I want even in a foreign land. Mmm mmm, I love simplicity.
