I really enjoyed Andrew Alexander Price's [blog post](http://www.andrewalexanderprice.com/blog20130330.php) entitled "Let's Build A Traditional City (And Make A Profit)."

The author entertains the thought experiment of desigining a pleasing place to live on a large plot of land within an exisitng municipality, for argument's sake the 151-acre former airport site for sale in Conway, Arkansas. His goal is to make a delightful place to live that also turns a profit for the hypothetical developer and the city.

His main argument, repeated a dozen ways in convincing photographs, is that streets ought to be narrow:

<pre class="prose">
The other side of the street should not feel like it is a world away - it should not be divided by a dangerous highway of heavy machinary. It should feel human-centric - safe, warm, inviting.  We should feel safe walking anywhere on the street. The street should not feel divided into a "left" and "right" side. We should feel like we are on the *entire* street. The secret to building these great warm homely-feeling places is so simple. The secret is to build narrow streets! That is all we have to do.

Environments hospitable to cars are inhospitable to pedestrians, and vice versa. America has consistently engineered the former, to the point that the latter can scarcely be found anywhere in our country.

I live in West Philadelphia because it is one of the few places in the country where you don't need a car. There is suitable transit, you can bike, and most amenities are even walkable. Yet Price's post has exposed to me the elephant in the room. Even here, an oasis of auto-nonreliance, we live under constant siege of car infrastructure!

Take the street I live on, 52nd Street:

Look how wide the street is! And how ugly! And in what disrepair!

How much did this street cost to pave, even just the segment in front of my block? How much has been spent every year to maintain it? How many people have been endangered or injured on it? Why is this cost never considered or even discussed, let alone known?

Instead of engineering and paying for a really smooth and safe big wide auto thoroughfare that pedestrians and cyclists could also navigate without fear of maiming, what if we considered just not letting cars through?

America is a great experiment, and it is supposed to be fertile soil for experimentation on the pursuit of the good life. That is one way of expressing in a nutshell what makes America great. I hope someone, somewhere in this country is able to run an experiment in livability even more radical than West Philadelphia, and closer to Price's ideal.
