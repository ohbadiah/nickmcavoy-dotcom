I have slept in a lot of beds so far in 2015:

- Grandpa and Grandma's in Potomac, MD
- Mine in Philadelphia
- Alan and Bethany's in Providence, RI
- Kevin's in Waco, TX
- Jeff and Callie's in Denver, CO
- Ben's in St. Paul, MN
- The Sadars' in Phoenix, AZ
- Grandpa and Grandma's in Goodyear, AZ
- Uncle Paul and Aunt Leesa's in San Francisco, CA
- Mine in Seoul
- Dan and Meg's on Jeju Island, South Korea
- Phil and Ava's in New York, NY
- Mine in Phoenixville, PA
- the cabin at Camp Innabah in Spring City, PA
- a hotel pullout in Pittsburgh, PA
- Jonathan and Stefanie's in Washington, D.C.
- Michael and Hanna's in Lancaster, PA

On the docket for the rest of August:

- Matt and Anne-Cara's in Philadelphia
- Jeremy's in Philadelphia
- A hospital bed in Bryn Mawr, PA

That will take me up to 20 beds on the year by the time I leave for Seoul again on September 1.

That's an average of twelve nights per bed. Most nights were spent in my beds in Philadelphia and Seoul, but actually only two were for only one night. I think too no one bed accounts for more than half of the nights on its own.

That's probably a decent measure for itinerancy. Now, thankfully I am a pretty solid sleeper, and I don't remember having any trouble sleeping in any of these beds. All the same sleeping in so many different places is wearying.

Yes, a bed isn't really the sort of thing you want to abstract over. That's exactly what I would do if someone asked me what I needed in one, though. I would say it doesn't really matter, that I just like something open and fairly firm, or not, with a pillow and maybe a blanket. I don't think "familiarity" would cross my list.

There have been good reasons to go to each place and person where I've found these beds. But it's metrics like these that remind me I wouldn't want to keep this pace of travel up forever.
