<pre class="prose">
Jesus said, â€œTruly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life.

He's right.

I have no heritage in Korea. I knew just a few people over there. Yet it was far easier for me to become planted there than might be expected. When I arrived not only was there a door for me to knock on but there was an entire apartment waiting for me. There were many restaurants, but my first food was a sandwich prepared in a home kitchen. This provision an much else like it were specifically because of the wisdom and generosity of Pastor Choi and Samonim and others at ICOS, but more generally because we all belong to Jesus.

For the Christian, home is wherever the Church is.
