One part technological novelty, two parts generosity.

I was looking in Korea for a birthday present for my mom. On my habitual walk to my favorite ramen restaurant, I noticed a shop offering laser engravings of photographs and graphics onto blocks of wood. Maybe shops like these are normal in some slice of human experience, but I had sure never seen the term "laser printing" carried forward quite so literally. After sorting at home through some photographs of the me and Mom I thought I had found my gift.

The next day I walked in to the shop, rather more confidently than I might have until recently given my early anxieties about using Korean, and conveyed my request without trouble. The proprietor asked me what size I wanted, the sizes coming in increments of ₩10,000 (about $9). I went with the ₩50,000 size, roughly 8 x 10 inches.

We set about preparing the photograph and starting the engraving. In a surprisingly short amount of time the picture began to be etched into the board and the smell of scorching wood filled the air.

At this point the proprietor hit me with the ol' Korean hustle.

We had agreed on a price of ₩50,000 KRW. He looked me in the eye and countered, "30,000." I was puzzled. "Discount," he said. I was quite pleased. "감사 합니다."

The engraving would take about an hour to complete, and after a while I took my leave to said ramen place. When I returned the finished board was waiting for me. It looked great! I reached for my wallet.

I was thwarted. The proprietor explained, more than once for my dull ears, that he thought it turned out really well. Would it be okay with me if he made another copy for a sample to display in the window? Surely it would!

In that case he would not accept any payment for the engraving at all, and he threw in a complementary sample as well.

This experience feels like a microcosm of my entire experience in Korea.
