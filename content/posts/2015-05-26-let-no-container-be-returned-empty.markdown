I made chocolate chip cookies recently on a Sunday after church. After giving most of them away to people around our guesthouse and some of the church youth, I still had a container left over. I suggested my friend Jinhee take them home to her family and she was happy to.

Now, back home, it seems you're lucky to see ever again a tupperware container once lent out. I think I still have the vegetarian chili container Calvin sent home with me in 2010. So when I sent Jinhee home with the cookies I considered the container all but a gift.

Much to my pleasant surprise, Jinhee brought the container back the next week. Not only that, but it wasn't empty! She had filled it with three small [Korean melon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_melon).

Apparently this wasn't just a nice gesture by Jinhee, but is actually something of a custom. I really like it, and it cast light on a memory from early in college.

My sophomore year my friend Pat and I lived off-campus for the first time. Sometime during the year, an Asian family moved in to the apartment next door. I wanted to welcome them so I made chocolate chip cookies and gave them a plate. The next day their little son knocked on the door and returned the plate, but not empty! It was full of delicious dumplings, really quite a treat.

I propose that moving forward this custom be adopted between all neighbors! Let no container be returned empty.
