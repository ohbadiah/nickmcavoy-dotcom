title: About this blog
---

Here's where I'll actually just write about my life. It seems conceited to have this on the Internet at all, but at least it's cordoned off in its own place.

In one of the more-read [posts](http://ohbadiah.blogspot.com/2010/05/what-is-purpose-of-photography.html) of my last blog, I mused on the purpose of photography. I decided that I aspired to take pictures like my friend Matthew. [His photographs](http://www.anchorstates.net/2009/12/snow.html) are personal and specific to his life, but they also are of such objective quality that you don't need to know him in order for them to be interesting.

In this space I'd like to practice storytelling in the same way. So I'll share anecdotes, but hopefully in such a way that they'll make a good story even if we've never met.
