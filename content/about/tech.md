title: About this blog
---
This blog is built from [an open-source blog](http://meta.plasm.us) built with [an open-source static site generation library](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) built from [an open-source programming language](http://www.haskell.org/). That is awesome.

I intend to write here about programming and software and computers. I mean these topics specifically, as opposed to my thoughts on technology generally, which can be found on [another blog](http://ohbadiah.blogspot.com). Anything from "here's how I did X" to "here's how I think things ought to be."

I like functional programming. I like free software and freeing software. I like encouraging people to take ownership of their computing. I like programming for everyone, especially those for whom no one is programming. I like security and privacy. I like the Internet.

Hopefully you'll find out about that here.

I don't have a comments system here (yet?), but please do [get in touch with me](http://nickmcavoy.com/contact). I'm kind of new at this, and I expect anyone reading this will have lots to teach me.
