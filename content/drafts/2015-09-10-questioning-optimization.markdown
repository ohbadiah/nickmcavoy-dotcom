Jesus said it:

<pre class="prose">
No one can serve two masters; either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will love the one and hate the other. And a house divided against itself cannot stand.
</pre>

Optimization quandaries:
- requires quantification, and quantification changes the thing you seek
- breeds perfectionism ("more", "perfect")
- obsession over the margins
