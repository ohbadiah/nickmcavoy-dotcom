```
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. THe old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
2 Corinthians 5:17
```

I understand this idea from Paul in terms of the categories of the flesh and the spirit that are found elsewhere in his writings. When a man becomes a Christian, the Holy Spirit births in him a new will. This new will, or "new man" as it is called, is no longer opposed to and alienated from God, but rather delights in God. God's commandments are no longer simply burdensome, but a joy to do.

But this new creation does not obliterate the old desire center, the one ruled by self-interest and marked by alineation from God.
