Smash. A bicyclist breaks through the passenger window of an idling Lexus at 52nd and Market, the epicenter of ungentrified West Philly. He makes off with a duffle bag from the passenger seat. The duffle bag contains approximately $144,000 in solid gold. The stunning theft is picked up by local news outlets.

This happened two days ago. I read about it on [philly.com](philly.com). I have no idea any other context to the story, but it raises a lot of questions. How did the thief know about the gold in the bag? Who drives around with solid gold of any value, let alone through that part of Philly? Was there some illicit purpose behind the possession to begin with?

The question I would like to explore in this scenario as well as many like it is: is it the driver's fault the gold was stolen? Does he or she have any right to be surprised or offended?

### It's not Dave's fault.
Let's call the driver Dave. I have no idea who it really was, man or woman, but it will be helpful to have a name. 

Of course the theft is not Dave's fault. Dave is not the thief. Dave has an acknowledged right to drive around with his possessions in his car without forefeiting them. This basic fact is not less true given that Dave was driving in a part of the city where you would be wise not to walk with a $20 bill sticking out of your pocket.

Yet in this and in countless situations like it, there are many who might blame Dave. The probable-enough presence of malefactors shouhld have been known to Dave, the reasoning goes, and he should have been more careful. Of course someone stole his gold. That's what you get when that's what you do.
