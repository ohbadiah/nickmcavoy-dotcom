Uncritical attention to the news is worse than ignorance.

I've always been curiously insensate toward the news. Famously, when my parents woke me on September 11, 2001 to tell me of attacks in New York and Washington D.C. I rolled over and went back to sleep. Guiltily, in the coming days near the front of my concern with respect to these world-changing events was when Major League Baseball would resume. Likewise, when Baltimore rioted in recent months, or when a white man massacred nine black churchgoers in South Carolina lastg week because they were black, I noticed the events themselves but also noticed the news didn't affect me emotionally as they did so many others, at least not right away.

I think there is something wrong with me. but in the same way a blood condition might shield me from malaria this defect may also help shield me from a worse malady.
