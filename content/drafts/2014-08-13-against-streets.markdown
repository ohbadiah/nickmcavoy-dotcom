I really enjoyed Andrew Alexander Price's [blog post](http://www.andrewalexanderprice.com/blog20130330.php) entitled "Let's Build A Traditional City (And Make A Profit)."

The author entertains the thought experiment of desigining a pleasing place to live on a large plot of land within an exisitng municipality, for argument's sake the 151-acre formaer airport site for sale in Conway, Arkansas. His goal is to make a delightful place to live that also turns a profit for the hypothetical developer and the city.

His main argument, repeated a dozen ways in convincing photographs, is that streets ought to be narrow:

<pre class="prose">
The other side of the street should not feel like it is a world away - it should not be divided by a dangerous highway of heavy machinary. It should feel human-centric - safe, warm, inviting.  We should feel safe walking anywhere on the street. The street should not feel divided into a "left" and "right" side. We should feel like we are on the *entire* street. The secret to building these great warm homely-feeling places is so simple. The secret is to build narrow streets! That is all we have to do.

Environments hospitable to cars are inhospitable to pedestrians, and vice versa. America has consistently engineered the former, to the point that the latter can scarcely be found anywhere in our country.
