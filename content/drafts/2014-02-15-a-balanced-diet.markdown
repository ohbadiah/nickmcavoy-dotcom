The past few months have not done my brain many favors.

A couple of changes have altered my cognitive landscape significantly. After months recovering from being hit by a car, I purchased a new car so I could return to work, my old routine of biking to the train station being untenable for the time being. 

Now, there was a reason why I had gotten rid of my last car in the first place. I didn't like what the morning commute was doing to my mind and my soul and so I wanted to eliminate the option to drive in order to incentivize biking and riding the train. But since I no longer had that option, I decided that if I must drive I would at least have a good sound system.

This change meant both that I would read much less and that I would listen to music much more. That's because the train was the primary source of my reading prior to my accident, and  due to pair programming at work there was no chance to listen to music.

The other cognitive shift is that since work has been very busy I have been working longer hours, and I have found certain coping mechanisms for the stress that mostly involve vegetating on the Internet in one way or another.

In general I would say I have missed reading, and that listening to more music has been very enjoyable. But even on the positive side, I question whether listening to this sheer amount of music is most profitable. I'm not a radio listener, nor am I a playlist shuffler, so I am either going to be listening to a sermon or to an actual album. And I have time for at least two albums in a day.

Music in this role can perform a very different function than if you just sit and listen to it. In this case I need the music to do something for me, namely to cope with the stress of commuting and whatever else is going on.
