I made a few quick stops on my way to Korea for the year.

Three weeks ago today my friend Matt dropped me off at the airport in Philadelphia on the way to my first stop in Dallas. I went through security with plenty of time to spare and sat down rather than proceeding to the gate, reflecting on how I had just left all behind. It would be long before I saw many loved ones again. Then Gerry Gutierriez walked by.

"Gerry!"

Turns out Gerry, a friend from church, was on my flight. Before long he had convinced Spirit to let us sit together, bought us Yards IPA's at the bar while the boarding commenced, and we convinced my host the esteemed Dr. Kevin Funderburk to come out for a drink with us once we landed.

It would be the first of many delights and surprises in the trip to come.

### Waco

The three of us did indeed go to a bar in Plano at nearly 2:00. Then we crashed at Gerry's relatives', went out to Mexican breakfast in McKinney, and bade Gerry a fond farewell.

I spent a long weekend with Kevin, a Roman historian at Baylor who did his PhD in Philadelphia and went to my church during that time, at many of his normal haunts in Waco. Waco sure didn't seem like a bad place to live! We sampled free wine and jazz at the local Wine Shoppe before attending a crepe night at a pastor's home, complete with the first question of the Heidelberg Catechism painted on the living room wall.

Kevin's church meets in the afternoon, so we went to the flagship Baptist church in town, the better for Kevin to get news from a mover and shaker at Baylor after the service. Lunch was a burger and shake meal from the unashamedly named (in the 50's) The Health Clinic which we ate in the park before a hike. We got early to Kevin's home church in order to set up chairs for the service. There's something exciting about the stage in a church plant's lifecycle when you're setting up chairs in a school auditorium for your afternoon service. Much like elementary school, you wouldn't want to remain in that stage forever but there's something special about it.

Kevin's Anglican church rocks.

Dinner afterward was Torchy's Tacos, an Austin joint with originality, good flavors, and an employee among our group who could order me the secret off-menu taco at the employee price. But was the evening finished? No sir. Kevin's friends from church, Ted the finance professor, Jeff the classics professor, and the head pastor Lee, came over for drinks and stayed late into the night. You see, many of them live just blocks away from Kevin and can pop over at a moment's notice. It was my kind of Lord's day.

Monday we biked into town and I set up shop at Dichotomy, which might as well be the town square. Dichotomy is so named because they serve not only coffee during the day but also cocktails into the evening. You can buy something called the Grad Student which entitles you to two coffees during the day and an alcoholic drink at night. Quality with a capital T. For lunch on campus I brought us burritos from Sergio's food truck, burritos with the most exuberantly larded house-made tortillas. We walked around the symmetric Baylor campus in the warm February summer sun. That night we saw the largest and loudest collection of birds I'd ever encountered roosting around the grocery store before enjoying steak and Brussels sprouts and that bottle of Wine Shoppe wine we began our time in Waco by purchasing.

It sure is a heck of a life that Doctor Funderburk has going for himself, and I didn't mind one bit being along for the ride. And I haven't even told you about the castle.

### Denver

When I booked my flight out ot Dallas it looked like I would need a layover in Denver. Frontier Airlines is cool and doesn't charge more for booking two segments separately than for one itinerary with a layover, so I asked my Denver friend Jeff if he would want to get together and host me on a Tuesday night. He did! What a guy.

I got off the plane and rented a car. The light right as I drove into Denver was otherworldly, a sort of crystal blue that made it seem like we were far closer to the sun relative to sea level than we really were. The light changed as I got into town and didn't reappear while I was there, so I'm glad I appreciated it while I saw it! That view and many others brought home the improbability of this entire civilization built in the mountains I had before only heard of.

The first person I talked to in Denver asked if I wanted to get high, no joke. He who offered was nevertheless a purveyor of fine barbecue, which Jeff and I availed ourselves of once we met. We walked through the Santa Fe Cookie Company, the funniest introvert business model I can recall. The woman just makes cookies all day and sets them in bags of 3 on a counter by the door. Customers leave a dollar bill in a large jar and take their cookies and go. No interaction necessary! The cookies sure were worth the price.

I hung out at a unique Denver bookstore while Jeff finished his day at work. We did happy hour and dinner and drove to his place outside the city where he showed me photography from he and his wife's year-long circumnavigational voyage before offering some helpful advice on my own photography and hitting the hay.

Jeff took me out to breakfast on Wednesday and we said goodbye. I found a small but intricately laid out and friendly coffee shop for the morning. In memory it reminds me of a white, well-illumined music box. Soon my time was up though and it was back to the airport for the end of my long "layover."

### Minneapolis

Minneapolis Ben Hanna's home, dear Ben from college, Ben of the wrist broken in the great lake battle, who brought the Horsemen to completion, Ben of the joyous cello who gave us baked rice and Wishek sausage. It had been about a year and a half; too long.

We went straight from the airport to his church's weekly small group meeting. This was potluck week and the theme was to try to replicate the burrito assembly line at Chipotle. There I finally met Amy, Ben's girlfriend of a year and a half who also goes to the group. The Summit Saga IPA testified to a brewing explosion in the Cities (as they call Minneapolis and St. Paul) and the heads of blonde hair and stories of music school testified to the people and culture of that region.

Thursday was finally a day reserved for work. I set up shop in Ben's living room while he went off to his law firm for the day. Midday I hiked out to a grocery co-op, bundled up for the low temperatures and surprised to find no one in the street but the man letting his dog out. As for the co-op, Texas had delighted me with its raw milk and also "rare milk," the name I gave to the half gallon of low-temperature pasteurized milk I bought in McKinney and drank entire on the way to Waco. As it turned out Minneapolis is not a raw milk free state, and even at a grocery co-op (of which there are many in the Cities) I had to content myself with raw milk cheese and other supplies for omelettes and PB&J. That night we went out to Neapolitan pizza.

Friday was another workday. In the evening we went to see the U of M take on the U of M in men's hockey (that's Minnesota against Michigan). It was fun! Despite some annoyances of overdramatic production, there were lots of touches of wholesome good fun, from the marching band to the figure skating cheerleaders to the between-period amusements on the ice to the 6-2 demolishing of Michigan with a hat trick by star Kyle Rau. We finished the evening as we had the night before by tasting with Amy the day's beer for FeBREWary, a splitting of a case of cases among friends in Ben's church, complete with numerical rating on a Google form.

Saturday morning we reveled in my delicious and unnecessarily complex method of brewing tea in a French press along with the spoils of my co-op hike. Then we were bound by the past versions of ourselves who thought it might be fun to go snowshoeing in zero-degree temperatures to go out to a park and do just that. As it turned out our past selves were right! Even though there wasn't much snow on the ground the snowshoes were useful and for me novel. We saw lots of animal tracks in the snow and a quite frozen creek and felt sufficiently warm in our many garments. It felt really good to use our bodies and get out there for a change.

Oh, and it was Valentine's Day. Amy in her graciousness and Ben in his generosity had decided to postpone their observance of the day for after my departure, but we still wanted to cook her a nice dinner. Broiled salmon and (more) brussels sprouts did nicely, and Amy brought over her own gift for the occasion, the best darn macaroons I have ever tasted. We had lovely conversation, speaking so often of the missing horsemen Zach and Josh that I went to try and get Zach on Skype. At that very moment Zach and Margie were playing Super Mario Brothers on my Wii in front of the computer! It was the sort of conversation that makes distances seem less great, especially since Zach and Margie had independent one-degree connections to Amy. Togetherness is great even when you can only taste it.

The St. Paul Chamber Orchestra was playing Beethoven's Ninth that night, and you can bet the three of us ate it up in front of Ben's basement sound system, with an "encore" of Brooklyn Rider's *A Walking Fire*  to close the delightful evening.

Sunday Ben and me went out to coffee and deep conversation before afternoon church. I appreciated his church was also going through I John, and their communal communion with everyone standing in a circle around the sanctuary was a first for me. Our last meal was as all last meals should be, sausage and baked rice, while I completed the SSD upgrade to [this computer](/tech/awesome-laptop). Alas, it was time to move on once more.

### Phoenix

Amy graciously got up early on her day off to drive me to the airport so Ben wouldn't have a hectic Monday morning. Before I knew it I was embracing Josh Sadar at the Phoenix airport, thus completing my circuit of the Horsemen. What's more, it was seventy degrees instead of zero. I changed into flip flops and a tee right on the sidewalk.

When I last visited Josh in Arizona his daughter Jenny was the same age as his eight-month-old Keziah is now. Jenny and eldest Isaiah didn't seem to remember me carrying them across the Grand Canyon rim July of 2013, but the time had been good to them. Now for the first time ever I observed firsthand that oranges do indeed grow on trees as I sampled with delight the fruit of their backyard. Josh and wife Hannah and his parents Steve and Marryann and Isaiah and Jenny and me held hands and sang a Doxology as grace for that night's dinner of baked ziti. Soon I was asleep in Isaiah's room against his bewildered questioning of whether I could "go home now."

Tuesday Josh drove me out to my grandparents' second home in Goodyear, from where I was to return on Friday. This taste of reunion with old friends left me peculiarly amenable to the idea of a retirement village; maybe one day we could all live together again as septagenarians. Grandma and Grandpa took me out to the club for Taco Tuesday lunch, and we wandered in the wilderness of Costco in the afternoon looking for the likes of bottles of unsweetened green tea. By this point the retirement fantasy was looking a little less appealing, or at least the version centered on golf and bargain hunting. 

Wednesday morning I discovered grapefruit. Maybe I had eaten grapefruit twice before in my life, but never this good and certainly never off a tree in the backyard. Actually all that week I ate large quantities of fresh citrus, as I fancy I would even if I lived there. Then we set out on a day trip that Grandpa had planned to Sedona. I drove us through a real western town called Wickenburg and up some 7,000-foot mountains into Prescott. I had never seen landscapes and vistas the likes of these before. We noticed that evening in Prescott was the memorial for courageous and compassionate and tragically killed ISIS prisoner Kayla Mueller, who was a Prescott native, but unfortunately we couldn't stay.

On through Jerome we went and at last came to Sedona, where the rock formations are just stunning. We drove back after sunset, enjoyed dinner at IHOP, and called it a night.

Thursday into Friday we stayed at home while I worked and planned contingencies around some visa difficulties I had discovered Tuesday night. I had never spent so much time with my grandparents just the three of us. We had a really good time together and even got to know one another better, which is a funny proposition for people who have known me my entire life. It was with a heavy heart and mcuh stalling that I had my last grapefruit and went with Grandpa back to Josh's that afternoon.

Sausages! Sausages, and hamburgers! And black pepper-rubbed thick bacon! Such were the delights that Josh planned for me that night, cooking for all 9 of us while Hannah and the kids and me played outside. Yes, any shyness on the kids' part had evaporated in the days I was in Goodyear. That night we played Pandemic and stayed up so late talking we decided against our planned Saturday zoo excursion.

Saturday morning I put the leftover sausage along with the neighbor's heavenly chicken eggs to good use. Then it was off to lunch with Youmie, the first person I'd seen in a long time from my first trip to Korea! We went Pizzeria Bianco in the heart of downtown Phoenix (such as it is), and it just so happened some major Japanese cultural festival was happening. Even at 3:00 in the afternoon there was an hour wait for two, so Youmie and I walked around the festival and talked. It was great to have a friend willing to drive 15 miles for pizza we had to wait an hour to be able to order, and Youmie felt the same. It was really good for me to talk with her about Korea past and present.

That evening Josh and me renewed the covenant, which is to say we began the process for making mead. When he left Philly we did the same thing, only I never racked it weeks later, and it is doubtless a gross mix of who-knows-what-by-now in Zach's basement. Much like how Israel through grace was not bereft when Moses broke the first stone tablets against the foot of Sinai, we made a new mead, and we found it much easier when we weren't in the midst of a move in a 90 degree stuffy third-floor apartment. By the end next morning it shimmered with potential and promise.

Sunday morning we went to Sovereign Grace Church in Mesa, my fifth church service in my fifth church in the month of February. It was great to be in a more evangelical church that was still focused on the matters of central importance. The sermon series is on Romans and it's called "Unashamed," either a reference to Paul not being ashamed of the Gospel, or of Josh's church not being ashamed of taking over a year to get through the epistle. After a yummy fajita lunch Hannah bestowed me with my new favorite t-shirt, a white-on-black presentation of Tolkien's Tree of Gondor. Josh and me had time together to talk and pray, and that was it! Time to leave again, but not before Josh and me met Youmie for dinner at a Cornish pasty place, sort of like an English burrito. Youmie took me to the airport and that was all for this desert excursion.

### San Francisco

San Francisco had really gotten the short end of my itinerary. As it planned out I wouldn't even be there for 48 hours, much to my chagrin and that of my Uncle Paul and other Bay Area family. But we were in luck! My visa difficulties brought me to the Korean consulate on Monday morning, and while it seemed like everything might be okay with the visa, I wouldn't be able to pick it up until Thursday. I extended my stay for 3 days!

I was in San Francisco just 5 months ago, and I come here with such frequency as to no longer require any of our favorite tourist destinations. Monday night we all went out for Italian. Tuesday I mostly worked and planned and stressed, but I did go for an e-bike ride into the old Sunset district where they (we?) used to live for horchata and Arnold Palmer. The ride back along the Great Highway next to the sun setting into the Pacific was a treat. We ordered a bunch of dumplings from a dumpling house for dinner, a big hit and the kind of thing you can't get in too many American cities.

Wednesday I worked all morning and picked up my 7th-grade cousin Noble from school. We went back to Sunset for sandwiches, a look at the old house, and ice cream at Polly Ann's in the middle of the afternoon where you can spin a big wheel of flavors if you agree to be bound to its result. My toasted almond bet paid off. That night I went to a small group meeting for City Church San Francisco, an older sister church of sorts to my church back home. It was good to make the acquaintance of the group and I met a man whose brother could use an invitation to my church in Korea. Small world!

Thursday was the performance to Monday's dress rehearsal. Aunt Leesa and me dropped cousin Justice off at work and we went to the consulate, where my visa was waiting for me and the correct kind! We then went out for breakfast at a pleasant place called Ella's promising "neoclassical American food." So far as I could tell, "classical" American food was when people cooked their food, and "neoclassical" means doing that again. Grandiose descriptors aside it was yummy. Then I was off to Palo Alto for lunch with Irene, Penn class of 2010, who I hadn't seen since Josh's wedding but who recently moved to the Bay Area as a software engineer like me. Coconuts was her restaurant recommendation and curried goat was her food recommendation. Both struck truly, and reconnecting was great. 

Then it was coffee with Ben Wiebracht, the English literature PhD student at Stanford. We only had an hour or so but it was enough to hear about him striking out on the job market (boo!), him maybe getting a 3-year postdoc at Stanford (yay!), and his new girlfriend Ashley the mechanical engineer (yay!). I strolled around Palo Alto, interested by their public invitations to reflection. Some kind of utopia there all right; maybe I'll build one myself someday.

The drive back from Palo Alto ws elysian. There was mist in the golden hills and the streams reflected in the valley and I had the windows down going 80 miles per hour. I went to my cousin-Boleses Bob and Christine next, talking with Christine on the couch over wine before going to see her son my cousin David's 3-D printer in the basement.

It was time for the last hurrah. The last hurrah turned out to be one last quart of raw mlik before going abroad and one heck of a Peruvian meal at Fresca on West Portal. I've had "lomo saltado" ringing through my head all day.

### Fin

This morning my cousin Justice took me to the airport. That was it. I couldn't stall anymore. It was time to go to Asia.

It would be nice to tie these cities all together with some reflections about their collective significance. I have some ideas, but I'm not sure so soon after is the best time to appreciate significance. The details of the events are clearest in my mind now, but patterns and conclusions remain to develop.

I'm over Japan right now. I'm going to land in Seoul soon. After a season of planning and intricate timing, I have reached the horizon of my plans. They got me here, but they can't see past here. What's next is known to God alone.

Let's see how this turns out.
