Many of us living in industrialized countries find that we weigh too much.

It's understandable enough. Many of us spend our workdays sitting down. Our jobs might still be really tiring but they're not using our bodies much. We get from place to place seated as well.

You could ditch the car. Driving is killing society and the planet anyway, so you might as well stop it from killing you, too. You probably don't live somewhere that biking is practical, so you might have to move somewhere that it is like Philadelphia. It turns out places you can live without a car are generally great places to live anyway, so you might as well. But not everyone is in a position to just up and move. Most will opt to just be overweight where they are.

For many people it will be more practical to eat fewer calories than to
