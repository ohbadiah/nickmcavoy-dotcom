I think fashion is overdue for an Internet revolution.

I've always been one to say as little as possible with my clothing. I imagine my wardrobe saying, "Oh yeah, Nick. He's a decent guy." This sort of clothing seems to be covered pretty well by the current marketplace. Most of what I wear has actually been given to me for my birthday or Christmas, so it's hard to say 

In recent years I've  

In short, it seems like for the prices I am expected to pay I should be able to have clothing custom-made. I could be wrong or crazy but it seems like:

- Fabric can't be very expensive.
- Retailers pay next to nothing for labor.

- literally, a label
- design
- overhead, like storefronts and warehouses

I don't find a label itself to be very valuable, so I don't feel right paying much for that. Design is certainly worthwhile, but I work in a profession where lots of amazing people give away their designs for free, so what makes Calvin Klein think he is so special? And sure, I guess you'll always have to pay for some overhead.

My experience with food gives me further reason to be suspicious of this system. A relatively small amount of food in America is actually prepared by the same people who eat it, or even directly for those people. But I find it is exactly this food that opens the way to a nutritious and satisfying life.
