  <p>I got a couple of lessons from church on a trip to New York last weekend.</p>
<p>The first was the reenforcement of something I first learned from my friend Youmie. It might be difficult to understand. I was amazed to learn from her in 2009 that she had missed church only a handful of times in her life. Missing church just wasn’t much of an option for her.</p>
<p>What is probably hard to understand about this attitude is that this constant attendance was linked neither to avoiding guilt for missing church nor to pride in having gleaming attendance. It was challenging to me because missing a particular Sunday had never seemed like a very big deal to me. Since that conversation I have tried to take on this outlook myself.</p>
<p>Doing so was a bit of a challenge yesterday. The reason I was in New York to begin with was for <a href="http://nescala.org">a conference</a> that I had helped organize and a morning of which I would hate to miss. Moreover, my absence would be noticed and I would have to explain that I was going to church, which can feel awkward around a bunch of people who by and large are not religious.</p>
<p>Still, I thought I had better stick to my guns. I went with my friends Phil and Ava to <a href="http://emmanuelnyc.org">Emmanuel Presbyterian Church</a> on the Upper West Side. And I am so glad that I did.</p>

  <p>At last night’s community group we studied <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+4%3A1-11&amp;version=ESV">1 Peter 4:1-11</a>. Verse 6 stuck out to me most:</p>
<pre><code>For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.</code></pre>
<p>The context is the change in the lives of Christians, that rather than being ruled by the passions of their sinful nature (the flesh), they be ruled by Jesus’s way of living which included suffering and dying.</p>

  <p>Why not start this blog with some heavy lifting?</p>
<p>A prominent question in Christian theology is that of free will. One of the hardest things to believe in Christianity is that not everyone will be saved; some portion of humanity will receive everlasting life and some portion of humanity will receive everlasting death.</p>
<p>But just what determines who is in what camp? Does God mostly leave it up to people individually? Or does he choose ahead of time? Two things that seem to be at stake are human responsibility and divine sovereignty. If the choice is not up to people, then it can be difficult to see how they could be held responsible for failing to choose life. But if the choice is left to people, then it could seem that God is powerless to save those he would like to but who choose otherwise.</p>
<p>The answer from Scripture seems to be something of a paradox. The Bible shamelessly upholds that God bestows his salvation on those and only those whom he chooses, and it also shamelessly urges all to repent and call upon the name of the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> for salvation.</p>
<p>From my perspective, our wills are neither as enslaved as we fear nor as free as we wish.</p>
