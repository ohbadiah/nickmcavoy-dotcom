  <p>At last night’s community group we studied <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+4%3A1-11&amp;version=ESV">1 Peter 4:1-11</a>. Verse 6 stuck out to me most:</p>
<pre><code>For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.</code></pre>
<p>The context is the change in the lives of Christians, that rather than being ruled by the passions of their sinful nature (the flesh), they be ruled by Jesus’s way of living which included suffering and dying.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<p>We discussed a few reasons for Christians to take up the painful life of dying to the passions that used to rule their lives. One reason Peter mentions explicitly is that such deeds will one day be judged before God. We all agreed that fear of retribution may be the least noble reason for good works, but it could still be a motivating force. Another reason we inferred from the text is that there is no escape from suffering. The fruits of living after the pattern of their former lives are likewise suffering and death. If suffering and death are to be had either way, we might as well suffer for good rather than for our own selfish passions. Peter himself makes this point earlier in his letter.</p>
<p>But the reason that was most provocative for me, and most difficult to imagine, was the final clause in verse 6, the promise of living “in the spirit the way God does.” Lately I have become the more aware of how tenuous life in the flesh is. If we enjoy prosperity and health in our lives, it can come to an end any day, and it is guaranteed to come to an end before too long. Over our lives looms the judgment we will receive after they end, the good account we must and cannot give.</p>
<p>Contrast that to the kind of life God enjoys: utterly effortless and self-consistent, unshakeable, joyous. Peter promises that this is the kind of life on the other end of suffering for the Gospel. More than a simple reward for doing good, it is nothing less than what he elsewhere calls to “partake of the divine nature.” God means not only to bless man as man, but also to elevate man with the mantle of divinity.</p>
<p>Wow. I’ll suffer for that.</p>

    <title>The Bondage of the Will</title>

  <p>Why not start this blog with some heavy lifting?</p>
<p>A prominent question in Christian theology is that of free will. One of the hardest things to believe in Christianity is that not everyone will be saved; some portion of humanity will receive everlasting life and some portion of humanity will receive everlasting death.</p>
<p>But just what determines who is in what camp? Does God mostly leave it up to people individually? Or does he choose ahead of time? Two things that seem to be at stake are human responsibility and divine sovereignty. If the choice is not up to people, then it can be difficult to see how they could be held responsible for failing to choose life. But if the choice is left to people, then it could seem that God is powerless to save those he would like to but who choose otherwise.</p>
<p>The answer from Scripture seems to be something of a paradox. The Bible shamelessly upholds that God bestows his salvation on those and only those whom he chooses, and it also shamelessly urges all to repent and call upon the name of the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> for salvation.</p>
<p>From my perspective, our wills are neither as enslaved as we fear nor as free as we wish.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<p>First, we are not automatons. Choice and consciousness are not illusions. (Proof is left as an exercise to the reader.) Christian argument against free will is not mostly of the sort that denies agency.</p>
<p>It is not that we have no will. Rather it is that our will is constrained by sin. The best analogy I can come up with is that of a shark swimming in the ocean. The shark is free to swim wherever it wills, and so it does. But the shark is incapable of standing up on a beach and walking on dry land. No one is stopping it per se, but no one needs to; the shark lacks the innate ability to walk.</p>
<p>Now, I do find Scripture persuasive on this matter, as well as the arguments of the likes of Martin Luther. But what persuades me most about the bondage of the will and the reason I have been thinking about it is that my own life constantly reinforces the idea.</p>
<p>It feels a bit silly to say this, but I experience the bondage of my will most palpably with my chronic lateness. I am late to almost everything I go to, and for no good reason. As a single and unencumbered man there is no other person who could make me late. Nor is it that I do not care about being on time. I actually hate being late and am ashamed of my lateness.</p>
<p>Yet it seems that one of the particular ways that I am fallen is that I am intrinsically incapable of punctuality. In a sense my mornings are like the movie Groundhog Day. Each has its own unique script, yet regardless of the details each converges on the same result.</p>
<p>My will is free. And every day my will chooses to be late. Wrap your mind around that and you will understand what is meant by the bondage of the will.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Holy Spirit, fill me up and take away my lateness.</p>
