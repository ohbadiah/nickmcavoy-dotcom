  <p>Why not start this blog with some heavy lifting?</p>
<p>A prominent question in Christian theology is that of free will. One of the hardest things to believe in Christianity is that not everyone will be saved; some portion of humanity will receive everlasting life and some portion of humanity will receive everlasting death.</p>
<p>But just what determines who is in what camp? Does God mostly leave it up to people individually? Or does he choose ahead of time? Two things that seem to be at stake are human responsibility and divine sovereignty. If the choice is not up to people, then it can be difficult to see how they could be held responsible for failing to choose life. But if the choice is left to people, then it could seem that God is powerless to save those he would like to but who choose otherwise.</p>
<p>The answer from Scripture seems to be something of a paradox. The Bible shamelessly upholds that God bestows his salvation on those and only those whom he chooses, and it also shamelessly urges all to repent and call upon the name of the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> for salvation.</p>
<p>From my perspective, our wills are neither as enslaved as we fear nor as free as we wish.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<p>First, we are not automatons. Choice and consciousness are not illusions. (Proof is left as an exercise to the reader.) Christian argument against free will is not mostly of the sort that denies agency.</p>
<p>It is not that we have no will. Rather it is that our will is constrained by sin. The best analogy I can come up with is that of a shark swimming in the ocean. The shark is free to swim wherever it wills, and so it does. But the shark is incapable of standing up on a beach and walking on dry land. No one is stopping it per se, but no one needs to; the shark lacks the innate ability to walk.</p>
<p>Now, I do find Scripture persuasive on this matter, as well as the arguments of the likes of Martin Luther. But what persuades me most about the bondage of the will and the reason I have been thinking about it is that my own life constantly reinforces the idea.</p>
<p>It feels a bit silly to say this, but I experience the bondage of my will most palpably with my chronic lateness. I am late to almost everything I go to, and for no good reason. As a single and unencumbered man there is no other person who could make me late. Nor is it that I do not care about being on time. I actually hate being late and am ashamed of my lateness.</p>
<p>Yet it seems that one of the particular ways that I am fallen is that I am intrinsically incapable of punctuality. In a sense my mornings are like the movie Groundhog Day. Each has its own unique script, yet regardless of the details each converges on the same result.</p>
<p>My will is free. And every day my will chooses to be late. Wrap your mind around that and you will understand what is meant by the bondage of the will.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Holy Spirit, fill me up and take away my lateness.</p>

  <p>I had a beautiful dream last night.</p>
<p>The whole world was anxious about something in outer space that was headed for Earth. It was visible in the night sky as a dark green star moving toward the zenith. We didn’t know what it was but we all remembered what happened to the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>When it got close, something from Earth went up and met it. Green turned to blue. I was relieved to infer that it would not be colliding with us, but in the next moment I realized the fallout from that interaction would be reaching us momentarily and for all I knew we were still going to get it.</p>
<p>I called my mom to warn her to take cover and I braced myself inside a narrow closet. I feared for all of the people who would be out in the open, unaware of the danger we still faced. Then the moment arrived.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<p>We were not annihilated. In fact, looking out the window, the whole world had been transformed. Though it remained deep night, all plants were aglow with luminescent pinpricks of all colors. It was like a natural Christmas display, but still with the softness of night.</p>
<p>We had feared not unwisely that the unknown celestial event would destroy us. But whoever sent it came to bless us in a way more wonderful than we could have imagined.</p>
<p>Usually only bad dreams wake you. But this one woke me right up.</p>

    </div>
  </header>

  <p>This is the first in what I intend to be a series of posts about particular foods.</p>
<p>Like alcohol, I came late to the party when it comes to coffee. Like alcohol, this was a result of a long-standing aversion to anything mind-altering as well as a reaction to the perceived abuses of my peers.</p>
<p>There seem to be few coffee drinkers who are not daily dependant on drinking coffee. That’s not quite a condemnation in itself but it is at least a red flag. Growing up my parents each had a cup of Folgers Instant coffee in the morning and after dinner. My mom in particular quite depended on this. One day she stayed home sick from work with a horrific migraine, feeling like death huddled in a mound beneath her bedspread. Around noon she remembered she hadn’t had coffee that morning and found her symptoms vanished shortly after she brewed a cup.</p>
<p>Then there was college. I slept so little in high school that by my sophomore year of college I was so burned out on not-sleeping that I resigned myself to doing whatever was necessary to get 8 hours per night. But few of my peers were converts to this gospel; they tended to use abundant coffee to fuel an unbalanced workaholic lifestyle. Naturally habits like this have persisted into the career realm for many of them.</p>
<p>So I have seen plenty of coffee dependence in my life, and I wanted no part of it for myself.</p>
<p>However, there was a sneaky little fact about coffee that also made me nervous.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<p>I knew that while I didn’t particularly like the taste of it, I could probably only have coffee about a half dozen times in my life before I would start liking it, cracking open the door to the dependence I feared. I don’t think my goal was to prevent this descent from ever happening as it once had been with alcohol, but to control it so that I would land in a good time and place.</p>
<p>I was pretty much right. I remember distinctly several of the occasions when I inched closer to the great bean. There was the sip of my uncle’s expresso at Maggiano’s in 2003, the Restaurant Week lunch at Zahav with Alan Wong, and the Reanimator brew Gene Twilley brought to the first church men’s breakfast he and I cooked together.</p>
<p>The tipping point came several months ago on a Sunday morning. I had stayed up late the night before carousing with Jon Kreamer in Washington D.C. and I was making my way back to Philadelphia to attend City Church. Arriving 45 minutes before the service started, I stopped at the coffee shop Lovers and Madmen for a quiche and a pourover. (Yes, like most things food-related, I vaulted straight into the ranks of the snob). I wanted to be alert for the service and so I took the plunge.</p>
<p>The result was wonderful. I savored every sip of the delicious coffee as it restored the vitality I had just spent. All through church I was even more alert than on a normal rested day, my mind running all over the subjects church presented for contemplation. And the wonderful nutty flavor stayed with me for hours.</p>
<p>So I have decided that I will enjoy coffee, but in an inverted way compared to most of the world. Rather than as a way to crank more productivity out of myself on less sleep, I will reserve it as a pleasure for the Sabbath. Rather than through the Monday morning grind, it will bring me to fullest worship on Sundays.</p>
<p>Maybe I was foolish to avoid coffee for so long, but I think it was exactly in waiting the way I did that I discovered a wise and relatively novel use for it. I like, even love coffee, but it is my servant and not my master.</p>

  <p>It was time to put Mrs. Parish to the test.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parish was my trigonometry and calculus teacher in 11th and 12th grade. She was a wonderful teacher. That’s part of why I remember from her class the claim that:</p>
<p><strong>“If you make just one extra payment per year on a thirty-year mortgage, you will pay the loan off in only 17 years.”</strong></p>
<p>This promise seemed like a bona-fide secret of life. Save half the time for an incremental increase in effort? Sign me up!</p>
<p>But was it true? I’d meant ever since to go over the math. I turned to my laptop to find out.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<h3 id="forget-math">Forget math</h3>
<p>I could have probably solved this problem with math. There are plenty of formulae <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_calculator#Monthly_payment_formula">readily available</a> related to this problem. Plugging those in would be straightforward.</p>
<p>But I wanted to be satisfied I understood what I was doing, if nothing else because otherwise down the line I might not really trust or remember what I found out. And when it comes to understanding, my comparative advantage nowadays is in programming, not in mathematics per se.</p>
<p>I remembered the fundamental law governing continuously-compounding interest:</p>
<pre><code>Balance = Principal * e ^ (rate * time)</code></pre>
<p>Periodic payments are easy enough to model, too, but an analytic solution for the time when the balance reaches zero did not leap off the page at me.</p>
<p>However, one thing I do know how to do is write a simulation!</p>
<h3 id="setting-up">Setting up</h3>
<p>The idea is you have a loan with certain principal, annual percentage rate, and suggested monthly payment:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Loan</span> <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Loan</span> {
<span class="ot">  balance ::</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>
,<span class="ot"> apr     ::</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>
,<span class="ot"> monthly ::</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>
} <span class="kw">deriving</span> (<span class="dt">Show</span>, <span class="dt">Eq</span>)

sampleMortgage <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Loan</span> <span class="dv">250000</span> <span class="dv">0</span><span class="fu">.</span><span class="dv">05</span> <span class="dv">1342</span><span class="fu">.</span><span class="dv">05</span></code></pre>
<p>Then you want to know, what happens if I make extra payments? Or, since it’s probably easier to set up, what happens if I make my monthly payment proportionately larger? Are these approaches interchangeable? We’ll call this behavior a RepaymentStrategy:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">RepaymentStrategy</span> <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Strategy</span> {
<span class="ot">  paymentsPerYear   ::</span> <span class="dt">Int</span>
,<span class="ot"> fractionOfMonthly ::</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>
} <span class="kw">deriving</span> (<span class="dt">Show</span>, <span class="dt">Eq</span>)</code></pre>
<p>I can think of two ways to evaluate the paydown of a loan. The first concern is how long it takes. Maybe you want to get the debt monkey off your back as soon as possible. But it’s also possible what you most care about is minimizing the total interest you pay. These two things should go hand in hand, but we’ll keep track of them both just to see:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">SimProgress</span> <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Sim</span> {
<span class="ot">  elapsedT      ::</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>
,<span class="ot"> principalPaid ::</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>
,<span class="ot"> interestPaid  ::</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>
,<span class="ot"> totalPayments ::</span> <span class="dt">Int</span>
} <span class="kw">deriving</span> <span class="dt">Eq</span>

<span class="kw">type</span> <span class="dt">SimResult</span> <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Either</span> <span class="dt">String</span> <span class="dt">SimProgress</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="letting-the-air-out">Letting the air out</h3>
<p>Writing this program helped me develop some intuition for paying down compound interest. As I reasoned I pictured the debt as an inflating balloon.</p>
<p>The debt balloon is always inflating. That’s interest. Every now and then you come over and let some air out. That’s making a payment.</p>
<p>Leave the balloon alone for long and you will return to find it unmanageably large. That sad reality is particularly true because interest compounds: the air that was just let into the balloon is now letting air into the balloon itself. It’s not just that the volume of the balloon (total debt) is increasing; it’s that it’s increasing at an increasing rate. It’s really easy to get into trouble with debt!</p>
<p>So it’s best to keep letting the air out. With each trip, you must let out more air than came into the balloon since your last visit, or you’ll never get it deflated. If you really want to get ahead, you need to let out a significant amount of air <em>over and above</em> the “interest air.”</p>
<h3 id="writing-the-sim">Writing the sim</h3>
<p>In an imperative language, the cycle of payments would be represented by a big <code>while</code> loop. Haskell doesn’t have those, so we’ll have to rely on recursion:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">
<span class="ot">paydown ::</span> <span class="dt">RepaymentStrategy</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Loan</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">SimResult</span>
paydown repaymentStrategy loan <span class="fu">=</span> step repaymentStrategy loan initialSimProgress

<span class="ot">step ::</span> <span class="dt">RepaymentStrategy</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Loan</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">SimProgress</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">SimResult</span>
step  s<span class="fu">@</span>(<span class="dt">Strategy</span> perYear fractionOfMonthly) l<span class="fu">@</span>(<span class="dt">Loan</span> balance apr monthly) sim
  <span class="fu">|</span> balance <span class="fu">&lt;=</span> <span class="dv">0</span><span class="fu">.</span><span class="dv">01</span>       <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Right</span> sim
  <span class="fu">|</span> (elapsedT sim) <span class="fu">&gt;=</span> <span class="dv">100</span> <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Left</span> <span class="st">&quot;That better not take more than a century to repay.&quot;</span>
  <span class="fu">|</span> otherwise             <span class="fu">=</span> step s (l {balance <span class="fu">=</span> balance'}) sim' <span class="kw">where</span>
      dt                <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dv">1</span> <span class="fu">/</span> (fromIntegral perYear)
      compoundedBalance <span class="fu">=</span> pert l dt
      payment           <span class="fu">=</span> monthly <span class="fu">*</span> fractionOfMonthly
      balance'          <span class="fu">=</span> compoundedBalance <span class="fu">-</span> payment</code></pre>
<p>Our top-level function <code>paydown</code> winds up its recursive child <code>step</code> and sets it running. <code>step</code> first checks to see whether the loan it has been handed has already been paid off; if so the recursion can stop and a successful result can be returned. Then, it sees if it’s taking more than a century to pay down the loan; if so there is probably something wrong and we will just exit the sim with an error message.</p>
<p>Barring those scenarios, we will let the balloon inflate for another payment period and then let some air out. The inflation (compounding) is defined by the “pert” formula listed above.<sup>1</sup> Our only inherent limitation should be the imperfections of floating point arithmetic, which I do not think will hurt us much.</p>
<p>Other than that, we figure out how much our payment is and we take it off the top. Phewww</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Was Mrs. Parish right? We turn to <code>ghci</code>, first with a sanity check:</p>
<pre><code>*Sim&gt; sampleMortgage
Loan {balance = 250000.0, apr = 5.0e-2, monthly = 1342.05}

*Sim&gt; paydown defaultRepaymentStrategy sampleMortgage
Right The loan will be paid down in 30 years, 1 months.
The composition of the payoff was  51.602483068740824 % principal, and 48.39751693125917 % interest.</code></pre>
<p>Yeah, yeah, our <code>Show</code> instance is beat. So what. More importantly, you might wonder if we have an off-by-one error: this is supposed to be a 30-year mortgage, not a 361-monther. But there are enough subtle differences between our sim and reality, for instance rounding to the cent, that I’m not going to worry about the small discrepancy.</p>
<p>Okay, Mrs. Parish, now <em>I</em> am handing <em>you</em> a moment of truth:</p>
<pre><code>*Sim&gt; paydown defaultRepaymentStrategy {paymentsPerYear = 13} sampleMortgage
Right The loan will be paid down in 25 years, 4 months.
The composition of the payoff was  56.62623594541301 % principal, and 43.373764054586985 % interest.</code></pre>
<p>Lies! I was promised 17 years, not 25! Or so I remember; I could be wrong. In any case, our 25 extra payments over 25 years saved us 45 payments in the long run! The interest proportion of our payment went down 5%! Considering that adding a twelfth to our payments is unlikely to make a significant difference to our budget, this move easily seems worth making.</p>
<p>What happens if we are even more aggressive in our extra payments?</p>
<pre><code>*Sim&gt; paydown defaultRepaymentStrategy {fractionOfMonthly = 13/12} sampleMortgage
Right The loan will be paid down in 25 years, 4 months.

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>First, we see the rough equivalence of making more payments and making bigger payments. More payments are a little better because air is let out more frequently, preventing new air from bringing in newer air, but it doesn’t make much difference here.</p>
<p>Second, we see that incremental increases in the payment make a huge difference! Increasing payments by a fourth cuts repayment time by a third, and doubling it does so by more than two thirds.</p>
<p>Third, we see our increases bring us diminishing benefit. Paying an extra 50% has a far greater impact than going from 2x to 3x our payment.</p>
<p>Based on these data, we begin to see the grounds for a more optimum loan-repayment strategy. In general, we <em>will</em> want to pay slightly more than the suggested payment on a loan, both in order to finish it faster and to pay less interest. However, we probably do not need to go overboard in doing so; more extreme increases won’t decrease repayment time or interest burden very much.</p>
<p>Thanks, Mrs. Parish!</p>

  <h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>The audio jack on my laptop broke, so I had to install a new operating system.</p>
<p>Tech support made me do it. Well, tech support and DRM. I had to get it fixed since I listen to music all of the time when I am computing. If my iphone wasn’t such a useless piece of hardware I would be able to transfer FLAC albums to it seamlessly through my Linux Mint installation. But since it is a useless piece of hardware my music was cruelly imprisoned, only able to speak to me through the tinniest of laptop speakers.</p>
<p>So I had to get it fixed. Fortunately the laptop was still under warranty. After the Lenovo guy over the phone was satisfied the broken jack was not caused by software, he asked me to mail it in to the repair center in Texas. That was fine, but there was one catch: they couldn’t promise my hard drive wouldn’t be wiped in the course of a repair.</p>
<p>Such was an occasion at least for a backup, but I was also worried the repair technician would get spooked by the presence of Linux on my system. What would he do when greeted with a GRUB prompt that would by default take him into not-Windows? Would he say my warranty had been voided by Free Software Poison?</p>

<h3 id="experiment-perilous-the-perfect-crime">Experiment Perilous: The Perfect Crime</h3>
<p>I needed to buy a hard drive to hold the backup. It seemed a good opportunity to get a solid-state drive. Maybe I would even permanently switch my 1 terabyte hard disk for the more flashy<sup>1</sup> option. Wait a minute! While I was thinking of swapping drives, I might as well move Windows from my HDD onto the SSD, then install the SSD into the laptop body. That way the tech support guy would be perfectly happy.</p>
<p>As tedious as this all may sound, it sounded like a fun project not just to me but to my good friend Matt. He pledged to join me.</p>
<h3 id="linux-fail">Linux Fail</h3>
<p>Once my SSD came, the two of us set about making a partition table to accomodate the several Windows partitions in my fragmented HDD. We tried a few tools for this, most notably GNU parted, fdisk, and the Linux Mint disk utility. All of them utterly failed in our case. The utilities would complete a couple of operations, then freak out and think there were no entries in the disk’s partition table.</p>
<p>What’s more, we were led to believe that Windows was not going to like waking up on a disk with different numbers in the partition table (as would be required on a disk of different size), on a drive of a different make than it thought it had been installed on. We moved on to plan B: Instead of installing a Windows-only HDD into my laptop, just hide Linux. Find a way to hide GRUB and to boot into Windows by default. Technician sees no evil, technician does no evil.</p>
<p>Now the SSD was only needed as a backup. But instead of leaving it merely a glorified flash drive, why not make the SSD a working Linux installation? We couldn’t see why not.</p>
<p>Shamefully, in the wake of the Linux tools’ failure to partition the drive we resorted to using Windows 7 to do the job, and it worked flawlessly. With the help of <a href="http://www.linuxliveusb.com/">this utility</a> and a flash drive, we had the newest version of Mint running on the SSD in a jiffy.</p>
<h3 id="a-security-issue">A Security Issue</h3>
<p>From there it was trivial to copy the 60 GB of files I cared about in my home directory to the SSD. A little too trivial, actually. Who was to say I had permission to copy those files if they weren’t marked readable? Well, <code>sudo</code> said. But not <code>sudo</code> on my original system; <code>sudo</code> on the new one. I didn’t need root access on the <em>source</em> disk to copy from it; I just needed it on the <em>destination.</em> That seemed a serious problem to me.</p>
<p>I suppose that is what full-disk encrpytion is for.</p>
<h3 id="hiding-grub">Hiding GRUB</h3>
<p>Hiding GRUB was easy. We could have edited the config file directly, but we preferred to use a little GUI utility that we installed through <code>apt-get</code>: <a href="https://launchpad.net/grub-customizer">grub-customizer</a>. We only needed to change two settings: <code>GRUB_DEFAULT</code> set the default OS to boot into, and <code>GRUB_TIMEOUT</code> set how long to wait before booting into that OS. With the default set to Windows and the timeout set to 0, the technician would need to look considerably deeper to notice another OS installed on the system. Most likely, she would see what she expected to and move on.</p>
<h3 id="linux-with-benefits">Linux with Benefits</h3>
<p>Our solution had one drawback: once we set the laptop to boot into Windows automatically, the normal process to boot Linux wouldn’t work. That could be annoying once the laptop came back. But our backup Linux install had already solved this problem! We could boot from <em>that</em> device, which would load GRUB, which would detect the Mint install on the HDD, which would allow us to boot into that and revert the GRUB configuration.</p>
<p>There were other benefits. Now that I had a disembodied installation with all of my files, I could boot into the SSD using another computer. That way while my laptop was gone I could continue to work and listen to music; it would be almost as if it never left.</p>
<h3 id="bios-fail">BIOS Fail</h3>
<p>In practice, the other machines I had available to me ran either Mac OS X or Windows 8. Unlike my laptop Macs don’t run BIOS; they run EFI. Likewise Windows 8 laptops have moved to UEFI. Neither system was eager to let me boot from my SSD. OS X wouldn’t even recognize the drive as mountable, and even after disabling Secure Boot the Windows laptop would only give me a cryptic information-less error message when trying to boot.</p>
<p>I could have tried harder to solve this, but given my laptop was only gone a week I didn’t find it worth it to do so. When I needed some files I used an EFI-bootable flash drive to boot into Linux on my Mac, copy the files to another partition on the flash drive, and boot back into OSX. It wasn’t exactly as convenient as I had envisioned but it worked.</p>
<h3 id="in-sum">In Sum</h3>
<p>Like all projects of this nature, I think Matt and I spent much more time than we intended and also learned more than we expected. The end result was satisfactory. Right now? I’m typing this on my laptop, listening to Gregorian chant on my sweet headphones through the audio jack.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Pun intended.</p>
