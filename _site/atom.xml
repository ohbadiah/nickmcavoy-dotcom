  <p>There are a million little projects I would like to build in my spare time and have sitting out there on the Internet. It’s tempting to get hacking on them as soon as I think of them, but that ignores an entire world of things that need to happen between committing the code and having it running on the Web.</p>
<p>Before software can be run, it needs to be deployed. Before it can be deployed, a server needs to be provisioned and waiting for it. Of course all of this can be done manually, but that only makes sense when n=1, i.e. never. So we’ll automate that, and while we’re at it we might as well try and mix in some of our favorite principles from software engineering proper, such as repeatability (idempotence?) and even immutability.</p>
<p>Chef and Puppet are the most popular tools for this kind of automation. At Relay we use Chef. I did not want to use either because I’m difficult like that; I’m not going to spend my free time writing Ruby or python if there is a good alternative. So I turned to Pallet.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<h3 id="about-pallet">About Pallet</h3>
<p>Pallet is a Clojure project, so you could almost say it had me at <code>(println &quot;Hello&quot;)</code>. I’m not any kind of an expert in Chef and I’ve never touched Puppet, so I don’t have a great idea of what each system’s distinctives are. But as far as I can tell here are some of Pallet’s emphases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pallet’s work does not start with a running virtual private server. Pallet uses JClouds to talk to cloud providers directly in doing things like spinning up server instances.</p></li>
<li><p>Nor does Pallet’s work finish when the server is provisioned. It can apparently be used to deploy your software, to start and stop services, and even to run administrative tasks. “To be honest,” the documentation admits, “this wasn’t an initial design goal, but has come out of the wash that way.”</p></li>
<li><p>Pallet doesn’t require any software to be installed on your destination servers. It just executes all of its commands over ssh from whatever JVM you run it on. This seems simpler than Chef to me.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-pallet">Using Pallet</h3>
<p>I created a Pallet template using Clojure’s build tool, Leiningen. It being a Clojure project, I loaded it into a new <code>lein repl</code> and was thus able to develop and execute right from my connected Emacs buffer.</p>
<p>For all of my projects I envision the same basic setup. Just like at Relay, I’ll put nginx in front of ports 80 and 443 and use it to serve up static assets and reverse proxy through to other webservers running for specific projects. Most of my projects will probably run on the JVM, so I’ll need to install java. And git will probably be necessary. So, for my first milestone I thought I would get a vps running with nginx, java, and git.</p>
<p>As for a target first project, this blog used to run embedded in a Play! framework app on Heroku, but I wanted to start hosting it in a vps. So I thought I’d start with the words you’re reading. Simple.</p>
<p>Here’s what I ended up with:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">(<span class="kw">ns</span> nmdc.groups.nmdc
  <span class="st">&quot;Node defintions for nmdc&quot;</span>
  (<span class="kw">:require</span>

  (<span class="kw">-&gt;</span> next-run <span class="kw">:results</span> <span class="kw">first</span> <span class="kw">:result</span>)
)</code></pre>
<p>If you can scrutinize the syntax a little bit, you’ll see the above code is about as simple as you could want for the task I described. A <code>server-spec</code> declares that I want to install git, java, and nginx. Then in a <code>node-list</code> I say my server is at a certain IP address running ubuntu. Then in my <code>provision</code> function I apply that spec to that server, executing phases for installing and configuring the software and reloading the nginx configuration.</p>
<p>I didn’t bother hooking Pallet up to my cloud provider digitalocean’s api directly because for the foreseeable future my projects will be able to run on single instances and there’s no reason to use a shotgun to kill an ant.</p>
<p>The only weird thing about this process for me was specifying the nginx configuration. Instead of giving the crate some relative path to the config files I want installed, it has me pass in the configuration in the form of a Clojure map. I thought that was weird. Maybe there’s a way to specify config files without cloning and modifying the crate itself; I’ll have to see.</p>
<h3 id="in-sum">In sum</h3>
<p>I don’t know if Pallet will ultimately prove a better choice than Chef or not. I was definitely able to get up and running with it faster than I could with Chef, but since the user base is smaller by at least an order of magnitude I may have to roll my own crates more often than I might with Chef. I’m also not sure how much Pallet actually takes functional principles to heart and how much it’s just a slightly more appealing wrapper for bash.</p>
<p>At any rate, I plan to keep using it and I’m happy with what I’ve done so far.</p>

  <p>Now that was the way it is supposed to be.</p>
<p>At 8:35 I looked at the clock and sighed a contented sigh. Two hours earlier I had left work. Two hours had been enough time to catch the train, ride my bike home, and cook and eat a satisfying meal despite having no prior plan.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<p>That’s what my CSA is supposed to do for me. CSA stands for community-supported agriculture. It’s basically a vegetable subscription. I sign up for a season and every week I pick up a box of goods from farms in Lancaster County. Everything is fresh and organic and, Pennsylvania being the bounteous land that it is, there is a lot of variety.</p>
<p>Without the CSA I likely would have eaten out somewhere. But with it, even though I had given no thought to Thursday dinner before Thursday evening I had plenty to work with without needing to stop at the store. I ended up cooking up some CSA baby red Russian kale and shiitake mushrooms along with some onion, garlic, and lemon I had on hand. I served it on thin toasted slices of the sourdough bread I make every week. It hit the spot!</p>
<p>And so I achieved something very rare for me: a delicious, satisfying meal that did not take much time, effort, or planning. After finishing I had so much time left over I decided to write a blog post.</p>

  <p>I got a couple of lessons from church on a trip to New York last weekend.</p>
<p>The first was the reenforcement of something I first learned from my friend Youmie. It might be difficult to understand. I was amazed to learn from her in 2009 that she had missed church only a handful of times in her life. Missing church just wasn’t much of an option for her.</p>
<p>What is probably hard to understand about this attitude is that this constant attendance was linked neither to avoiding guilt for missing church nor to pride in having gleaming attendance. It was challenging to me because missing a particular Sunday had never seemed like a very big deal to me. Since that conversation I have tried to take on this outlook myself.</p>
<p>Doing so was a bit of a challenge yesterday. The reason I was in New York to begin with was for <a href="http://nescala.org">a conference</a> that I had helped organize and a morning of which I would hate to miss. Moreover, my absence would be noticed and I would have to explain that I was going to church, which can feel awkward around a bunch of people who by and large are not religious.</p>
<p>Still, I thought I had better stick to my guns. I went with my friends Phil and Ava to <a href="http://emmanuelnyc.org">Emmanuel Presbyterian Church</a> on the Upper West Side. And I am so glad that I did.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<p>While I did miss talks I would have liked to see, the Holy Spirit met me at the church service in a big way. This happened in a few ways, but I would like to focus on one.</p>
<p>The offertory. Wow. A member of the church played an etude by Chopin. This was an entirely different level than I had ever conceived of. My own church is blessed with excellent musicians, but I confess that I think of the music played during the offertory as not very much more than background music, without which silence during the passing of collection plates might be awkward.</p>
<p>But this was no mere offertory. It was itself an offering. This was a concert-quality performance by a concert-quality musician. It was not timed to conclude once the monetary offerings had been collected. It slayed and I nearly cried.</p>
<p>When the performance ended, no one clapped. The artist returned to her seat in silence, depths of emotion I could not read playing across her face.</p>
<p>I was convicted that this was as much an offering as if we had taken a choice bull to the altar and slain it on the spot. What a gift it was, I realized, to be able to give one’s first and one’s best to the Lord. Like my decision to go to church that morning, this was not a burden but the loosing of one.</p>
<p>I wondered how we could take this principle farther into the reaches of our lives. I imagined taking the first pint from one of the batches of beer we brew for our church parties and pouring it out on the ground. I imagined owning a restaurant and giving the first hour’s service to such as live in shelters. I imagined working hard on Saturdays for software to benefit churches.</p>
<p>Such are not ways to fool or bargain God into giving us what we really want. Rather they are a means to know him, to come to want him most, which is our end.</p>
<p>Lord, may I ever remember the beauty of the Chopin offering. May we know the joy of offering you our first and our best.</p>

  <p>At last night’s community group we studied <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+4%3A1-11&amp;version=ESV">1 Peter 4:1-11</a>. Verse 6 stuck out to me most:</p>
<pre><code>For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.</code></pre>
<p>The context is the change in the lives of Christians, that rather than being ruled by the passions of their sinful nature (the flesh), they be ruled by Jesus’s way of living which included suffering and dying.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<p>We discussed a few reasons for Christians to take up the painful life of dying to the passions that used to rule their lives. One reason Peter mentions explicitly is that such deeds will one day be judged before God. We all agreed that fear of retribution may be the least noble reason for good works, but it could still be a motivating force. Another reason we inferred from the text is that there is no escape from suffering. The fruits of living after the pattern of their former lives are likewise suffering and death. If suffering and death are to be had either way, we might as well suffer for good rather than for our own selfish passions. Peter himself makes this point earlier in his letter.</p>
<p>But the reason that was most provocative for me, and most difficult to imagine, was the final clause in verse 6, the promise of living “in the spirit the way God does.” Lately I have become the more aware of how tenuous life in the flesh is. If we enjoy prosperity and health in our lives, it can come to an end any day, and it is guaranteed to come to an end before too long. Over our lives looms the judgment we will receive after they end, the good account we must and cannot give.</p>
<p>Contrast that to the kind of life God enjoys: utterly effortless and self-consistent, unshakeable, joyous. Peter promises that this is the kind of life on the other end of suffering for the Gospel. More than a simple reward for doing good, it is nothing less than what he elsewhere calls to “partake of the divine nature.” God means not only to bless man as man, but also to elevate man with the mantle of divinity.</p>
<p>Wow. I’ll suffer for that.</p>

  <p>A recurring motif in dreams in which my father appears is that I embrace him.</p>
<p>The embrace is one part joy at having him wth me again and one part fear of losing him again.</p>
<p>Ten years after his death I am glad that I still have these dreams. These emotions ought not be buried beneath forgetfulness. And the dreams remind me to pray that they come true.</p>

  <p>Biycycles are inanimate, but there remains a deep affection of the rider for his mount. This affection can extend even to identification.</p>
<p>I took my bike to the bike shop this weekend and it was cathartic. The bike was already in a shop, but I took it to Via Bicycle where they were more likely to have a matching fork in the event a replacement was necessary. To myself I jokingly called the move a “patient transfer.”</p>
<p>The owner of Via Bicycle reintroduced himself as Curtis, but with a moustache and a manner with a crowd of customers like his no reintroduction was necessary. Curtis lives up to this image, too; it’s not an exaggeratin to call him a bicycle sage.</p>
<p>Curtis put my bike on a stand and told me about its damage, his eyes finding in a minute what others’ instruments had missed. This after the car accident that put me out of commission for almost five months.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<p>At first glance the bike was okay. But Curtis had me crouch a bit and look at the top tube at eye level. Yup, now that I looked at it, it definitely bent downward near the front. Not so much the integrity was threatened, but enough to notice, and matter.</p>
<p>Come to look at it, the handlebars were bent, too. The brake lever was way off line, the headset worse for the wear. The scuffs on the cork tape revealed an intimate acquaintance with the road.</p>
<p>There was considerably more damage than met the casual eye. There is an identification of the rider with his mount.</p>

  <p>I am not very good at getting chores done.</p>
<p>I find the simple act of making a list of tasks greatly increases the likelihood that I will do them. I can have a task in my mind for weeks without doing it, even if it is as simple as a phone call. Yet somehow when I make the list something clicks and I start knocking off items.</p>

  <p>Why not start this blog with some heavy lifting?</p>
<p>A prominent question in Christian theology is that of free will. One of the hardest things to believe in Christianity is that not everyone will be saved; some portion of humanity will receive everlasting life and some portion of humanity will receive everlasting death.</p>
<p>But just what determines who is in what camp? Does God mostly leave it up to people individually? Or does he choose ahead of time? Two things that seem to be at stake are human responsibility and divine sovereignty. If the choice is not up to people, then it can be difficult to see how they could be held responsible for failing to choose life. But if the choice is left to people, then it could seem that God is powerless to save those he would like to but who choose otherwise.</p>
<p>The answer from Scripture seems to be something of a paradox. The Bible shamelessly upholds that God bestows his salvation on those and only those whom he chooses, and it also shamelessly urges all to repent and call upon the name of the <span class="yhwh">Lord</span> for salvation.</p>
<p>From my perspective, our wills are neither as enslaved as we fear nor as free as we wish.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<p>First, we are not automatons. Choice and consciousness are not illusions. (Proof is left as an exercise to the reader.) Christian argument against free will is not mostly of the sort that denies agency.</p>
<p>It is not that we have no will. Rather it is that our will is constrained by sin. The best analogy I can come up with is that of a shark swimming in the ocean. The shark is free to swim wherever it wills, and so it does. But the shark is incapable of standing up on a beach and walking on dry land. No one is stopping it per se, but no one needs to; the shark lacks the innate ability to walk.</p>
<p>Now, I do find Scripture persuasive on this matter, as well as the arguments of the likes of Martin Luther. But what persuades me most about the bondage of the will and the reason I have been thinking about it is that my own life constantly reinforces the idea.</p>
<p>It feels a bit silly to say this, but I experience the bondage of my will most palpably with my chronic lateness. I am late to almost everything I go to, and for no good reason. As a single and unencumbered man there is no other person who could make me late. Nor is it that I do not care about being on time. I actually hate being late and am ashamed of my lateness.</p>
<p>Yet it seems that one of the particular ways that I am fallen is that I am intrinsically incapable of punctuality. In a sense my mornings are like the movie Groundhog Day. Each has its own unique script, yet regardless of the details each converges on the same result.</p>
<p>My will is free. And every day my will chooses to be late. Wrap your mind around that and you will understand what is meant by the bondage of the will.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Holy Spirit, fill me up and take away my lateness.</p>

  <p>I had a beautiful dream last night.</p>
<p>The whole world was anxious about something in outer space that was headed for Earth. It was visible in the night sky as a dark green star moving toward the zenith. We didn’t know what it was but we all remembered what happened to the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>When it got close, something from Earth went up and met it. Green turned to blue. I was relieved to infer that it would not be colliding with us, but in the next moment I realized the fallout from that interaction would be reaching us momentarily and for all I knew we were still going to get it.</p>
<p>I called my mom to warn her to take cover and I braced myself inside a narrow closet. I feared for all of the people who would be out in the open, unaware of the danger we still faced. Then the moment arrived.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<p>We were not annihilated. In fact, looking out the window, the whole world had been transformed. Though it remained deep night, all plants were aglow with luminescent pinpricks of all colors. It was like a natural Christmas display, but still with the softness of night.</p>
<p>We had feared not unwisely that the unknown celestial event would destroy us. But whoever sent it came to bless us in a way more wonderful than we could have imagined.</p>
<p>Usually only bad dreams wake you. But this one woke me right up.</p>

  </header>

  <p>This is the first in what I intend to be a series of posts about particular foods.</p>
<p>Like alcohol, I came late to the party when it comes to coffee. Like alcohol, this was a result of a long-standing aversion to anything mind-altering as well as a reaction to the perceived abuses of my peers.</p>
<p>There seem to be few coffee drinkers who are not daily dependant on drinking coffee. That’s not quite a condemnation in itself but it is at least a red flag. Growing up my parents each had a cup of Folgers Instant coffee in the morning and after dinner. My mom in particular quite depended on this. One day she stayed home sick from work with a horrific migraine, feeling like death huddled in a mound beneath her bedspread. Around noon she remembered she hadn’t had coffee that morning and found her symptoms vanished shortly after she brewed a cup.</p>
<p>Then there was college. I slept so little in high school that by my sophomore year of college I was so burned out on not-sleeping that I resigned myself to doing whatever was necessary to get 8 hours per night. But few of my peers were converts to this gospel; they tended to use abundant coffee to fuel an unbalanced workaholic lifestyle. Naturally habits like this have persisted into the career realm for many of them.</p>
<p>So I have seen plenty of coffee dependence in my life, and I wanted no part of it for myself.</p>
<p>However, there was a sneaky little fact about coffee that also made me nervous.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<p>I knew that while I didn’t particularly like the taste of it, I could probably only have coffee about a half dozen times in my life before I would start liking it, cracking open the door to the dependence I feared. I don’t think my goal was to prevent this descent from ever happening as it once had been with alcohol, but to control it so that I would land in a good time and place.</p>
<p>I was pretty much right. I remember distinctly several of the occasions when I inched closer to the great bean. There was the sip of my uncle’s expresso at Maggiano’s in 2003, the Restaurant Week lunch at Zahav with Alan Wong, and the Reanimator brew Gene Twilley brought to the first church men’s breakfast he and I cooked together.</p>
<p>The tipping point came several months ago on a Sunday morning. I had stayed up late the night before carousing with Jon Kreamer in Washington D.C. and I was making my way back to Philadelphia to attend City Church. Arriving 45 minutes before the service started, I stopped at the coffee shop Lovers and Madmen for a quiche and a pourover. (Yes, like most things food-related, I vaulted straight into the ranks of the snob). I wanted to be alert for the service and so I took the plunge.</p>
<p>The result was wonderful. I savored every sip of the delicious coffee as it restored the vitality I had just spent. All through church I was even more alert than on a normal rested day, my mind running all over the subjects church presented for contemplation. And the wonderful nutty flavor stayed with me for hours.</p>
<p>So I have decided that I will enjoy coffee, but in an inverted way compared to most of the world. Rather than as a way to crank more productivity out of myself on less sleep, I will reserve it as a pleasure for the Sabbath. Rather than through the Monday morning grind, it will bring me to fullest worship on Sundays.</p>
<p>Maybe I was foolish to avoid coffee for so long, but I think it was exactly in waiting the way I did that I discovered a wise and relatively novel use for it. I like, even love coffee, but it is my servant and not my master.</p>
