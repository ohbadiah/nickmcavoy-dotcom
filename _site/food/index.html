  <p>This is the first in what I intend to be a series of posts about particular foods.</p>
<p>Like alcohol, I came late to the party when it comes to coffee. Like alcohol, this was a result of a long-standing aversion to anything mind-altering as well as a reaction to the perceived abuses of my peers.</p>
<p>There seem to be few coffee drinkers who are not daily dependant on drinking coffee. That’s not quite a condemnation in itself but it is at least a red flag. Growing up my parents each had a cup of Folgers Instant coffee in the morning and after dinner. My mom in particular quite depended on this. One day she stayed home sick from work with a horrific migraine, feeling like death huddled in a mound beneath her bedspread. Around noon she remembered she hadn’t had coffee that morning and found her symptoms vanished shortly after she brewed a cup.</p>
<p>Then there was college. I slept so little in high school that by my sophomore year of college I was so burned out on not-sleeping that I resigned myself to doing whatever was necessary to get 8 hours per night. But few of my peers were converts to this gospel; they tended to use abundant coffee to fuel an unbalanced workaholic lifestyle. Naturally habits like this have persisted into the career realm for many of them.</p>
<p>So I have seen plenty of coffee dependence in my life, and I wanted no part of it for myself.</p>
<p>However, there was a sneaky little fact about coffee that also made me nervous.</p>
