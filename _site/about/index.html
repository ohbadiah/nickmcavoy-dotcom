        <h1>About this blog</h1>
<p>I like ordinary things, but I like them deeply.</p>
<p>I <a href="../tech/about/">built this site</a> so I could enjoy several flavors of freedom.</p>
<p>The first freedom I am seeking is the freedom from self-promotion. Most self-expression on the Internet these days happens on social media platforms. As the medium is most certainly the message, this self-expression is inevitably bound up with self-promotion. We aren’t <em>just</em> expressing ourselves; we are trying to build and expand our personal brands so that our voices will become more influential.</p>
<p>This blog is my way of waving the white flag toward and bowing out of that competition. No one is going to read this except people who already know and care about me, and I am not just okay with that; I relish it. I’ll track pageviews and such once I get around to writing that, but I hope mostly as a curiosity, and I don’t plan on making that information public. At this place I hope to separate expression from ambition.</p>
<p>Authoring not only the words coming out of this microphone but the microphone itself is a source of commercial freedom. If this content is being processed and profited from by someone other than myself, it is in a far smaller and less direct fashion than the way this occurs when I used any of the readily-available “free” platforms so popular on the Web.</p>
<p>Controlling not just the placement of the furniture in the house but the very structure of the house itself (you’ll find I use a lot of metaphors) is also an abundant source of creative freedom. For instance, the way I have built this place, as a cluster of only loosely-coupled topical blogs, gives me a freedom of audience I have long coveted. It is in my nature to have broad interests, and I have not yet met anyone who shares all of them. I have very often refrained from saying something online because I know only a fraction of the people hearing it will even possibly care. Even more inhibiting, I have feared consequences to for instance my career for expressing for instance my Christian beliefs. By separating these kinds of expression and making readers bring them together only by their own volition, I allow them to hear me say only the kinds of things they are interested in hearing. That frees me to say all I want to within each category; no one is going to find anything they did not ask to see.</p>
<p>A final, related freedom is the freedom of self-indulgence that comes from having my own little barely-advertised corner of the Internet to myself. Because I am not thrusting these words into a marketplace, there is a much lower burden of responsibility on me for my words. They only claim I will make of my opinions is tautological; I do not claim they are correct, interesting, novel, or informed, but I do admit they are mine. If they reveal me to be wrong, boring, unoriginal, or ignorant then so be it, but you found them on my blog and so you asked for them.</p>
<p>That said, I do aspire to quality, along with the virtues of charity, humility, and clarity, and I would not write this without some presumption or hope of an audience. Please do hold me accountable to making something worth reading.</p>
<p>I am doing all of this because I am too incurably extroverted to keep a journal to myself. My hope is that in knowing this blog you would come to know me, and in coming to know me you would make your knowing known to me so that I may know you, too.</p>
