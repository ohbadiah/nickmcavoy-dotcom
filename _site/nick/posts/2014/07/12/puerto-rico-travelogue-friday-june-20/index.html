  <p>Mom, Mark and I had a 7am departure from the airport. I elected to take the trolley to the regional rail in order to arrive around 5:30. I was in a hurry and so drove to the trolley stop and ended up getting $60 in parking tickets because of street cleaning. Oops. The Southwest flight attendants were of unusually good humor and we arrived without event around 1pm. At the airport we met Samantha and Jace.</p>
<p>We were immediately impressed by the heat, humidity, and intensity of sunlight. It seemed we pale northeasterners might wilt in the island heat, especially as we waited for Mark to unlose himself en route back to the airport with the rental car. However we would soon be acclimated to the weather and find it rather pleasant.</p>
<p>We considered meeting up with Uncle Paul and family in Old San Juan where they were staying until Sunday, but not having a map or a great idea where we were going, and our landlady being insistent about meeting us at our rental apartment in Luquillo, we continued on straight. “TU MUNDO ES LIBERTY” greeted us from a mountainside as we drove east on 66.</p>

<p>Our landlady Maritza was a character. A New York Puerto Rican, she spoke English so fast that some despaired of understanding her were she to use Spanish. She was also frank about herself, the culture of Puerto Ricans who have not lived in the States (effectively calling them lazy as a rule), and so forth.</p>
<p>The apartment was in a neighborhood that was clearly once very upscale but was not so much now. On the one hand were the neighbors with their two Mercedes parked conspicuously by the road but safely behind a gate, and on the other were stray dogs, chickens, and many neighborhood folk who were clearly not upper class. The back wall of the apartment opened through French doors to a balcony that overlooked the ocean by no more than a hundred yards. Walking out of the bedroom to eternity lapping at our back wall became a surreal and delightful experience through the week.</p>
<p>For dinner we ventured to the Luquillo kioscos, a long strip of sixty or so shops and restaurants maybe a mile east of our place. We found ourselves at a Maritza-recommended restaurant, one Don Coqui, and were privileged to meet the hostess Diane. Another New York Puerto Rican, she was generous, made us feel at ease, and spoke fondly of her grandchildren. Puerto Rico clearly being a land of rum, I ordered my first piña colada as well as my first mofongo. While we waited for the food Mark took up a game of pool and the jukebox with who proved to be a southeast Pennsylvania native anthropology PhD student and his Japanese friend or companion. The man was studing religion in Puerto Rico, something about how African spirituality was manifest in Puerto Rican religious practice.</p>
<p>From there we went to the Amigo grocery store in San Juan. In the ten years since we were last in Puerto Rico it was apparently bought out by Walmart. Produce shows prominently where it comes from. Unfortunately as Diane warned us mangoes did not seem to yet be in season, even though they came from Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Once home we discovered the wireless Internet worked passably except for my Apple products. I nevertheless was able to plug into the router via Ethernet. This having been quite enough for one day, we retired and were soon sleeping fast by the loud hum of the bedroom air conditioners.</p>
