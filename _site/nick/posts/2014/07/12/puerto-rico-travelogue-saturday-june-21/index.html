  <p>Mom made breakfast in our little kitchen. The kitchen itself was not outfit well for serious cooking. There was no oven, and finding simple things like mixing bowls was a little difficult. Nevertheless the challenge was nothing Mom was not up to, and we enjoyed scrambled eggs and toast made with pan de agua.</p>
<p>Afterwards we packed up and went to Luquillo Beach, just a mile or so farther down the coastline. You could see it from our apartment and hear it too, beacuse for most of the time loud music was playing near the water and the bass would make it all the way to our ears. The beach itself was dominated by locals. We all noticed how they seemed to have less stress about body image than mainland Americans, since all manner of human body was hanging comfortably out of swimsuits wherever we looked.</p>

<p>The sand wasn’t anything too special and you did seem to have to watch out for ants. The water, however, was wonderful. Cool, still, clear, and very salty, it was effortless to float in. The four of us without Mark actually held hands in a chain floating on our backs at one point. Floating there and seeing the sun through your eyelids felt something like a return to the womb. I enjoyed swimming for the first time since my auto accident last fall, finding the water resistance good for my recovering joints.</p>
<p>At lunchtime we left our towels and beach things and made for the kioscos on foot. We observed more comfortable Puerto Rican bodies, some games in the sand, and some impressive coniferous trees. Eventually we got to a point where we would need to walk across a narrow row of cinderblocks over a small concrete structure over a pond, or walk around a long way. We decided to go the short way, and one or two of us found the big step across the middle of the bridge to be on the frightening side. Mom paused for a good while, frozen. I was last in line and too felt a pang of hesitation when it was my time, but Sam told me there was someone waiting behind me, I suddenly realized it was no big deal, and with the problem solved in my mind I went across without any further problem. On the way back we took the longer way.</p>
<p>There was some disagreement about our lunch location. All of the places seemed identical with the same fried Puerto Rican dishes like plantains or pasteles in the window. Samantha favored the first place we walked through since it was full of locals, but Mom and I did not want to be around the likes of a man who had been on a slot machine for far too long (there were slots in the restaurant). We ended up at a place called the Ceviche Hut, more unique than the other places but more expensive as well. Each of the couples split a dish while I actually ordered ceviche, which I found delightful.</p>
<p>We were not back in the water for long before our big incident of the day occurred. Mark remained on the shore while the rest of us swam more. He got up to buy some ice cream, leaving his wallet and mine in the cooler with our stuff. A group of youths next to us had been drinking all day and did not seem to be up to much good. Mark kept an eye on the wallets and saw one of them take the wallets and take off.</p>
<p>From my perspective in the water (under the shadow of misty El Yunque far in the distance) I said to Mom, “Hey, Mark is running really fast.” I thought he must have found a game with some locals. Mom’s guess was far more accurate. “I wonder if someone stole the wallets.”</p>
<p>Give adrenaline and Mark some credit. Drunk or no, Mark had 40 years on the thief, but he caught him quickly. The kid evidently realized that Mark was going to catch and tackle him and was so afraid he just threw the wallets away. This after attempting to blend in with his friends who all tried to play dumb.</p>
<p>By the time first I then the rest of us arrived from the beach, Mark was sitting on the cooler confronted with 3 of the other drunken youths. They were obnoxious in their attempts at conciliation, trying to get Mark to offer a handshake. “You can’t do bad in life. You got to do good in life. Jesus wouldn’t approve of him or what you were doing today,” he warned them sternly.</p>
<p>With that we certainly were not going to stick around at the beach. We packed up. On our way out we came across beach patrollwomen. Mark told them about the incident and tried to go with them to find the men. This made a bit more of a spectacle than we already had on our hands. “I’m so sorry about this,” one dear woman said to us as she passed. Nothing much came of the patrol, and we left.</p>
<p>Dinner that night was cheeseburgers at home. We were beginning to learn that Amigo was not the best place to spend our vacation. The lines were just slow moving and the drive was just a bit out of the way. Dinner at any rate was quite serviceable, and we discovered the kitchen was far better outfit for mixing drinks than it was for real food. Samantha and Jace and I followed the old adage (“When in rum [country], do as the rum [drinkers] do”) and made delicious piña coladas which we sipped from tall coqui-printed glasses.</p>
<p>As night drew on we closed the French doors on the balcony, shutting ocean and mosquitos out and air conditioning in.</p>
