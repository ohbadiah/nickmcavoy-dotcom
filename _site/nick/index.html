  <p>Prior to the trip I entertained the thought of finding a Puerto Rican church to go to. Once there I even looked up a Presbyterian church in nearby Rio Grande. Not sure how I would get there, I thought I could at least tag along with Mom and Mark to mass. As it played out, however, I simply slept too late to do any of that.</p>
<p>They evidently endured quite a long sermon of which Mark understood zero words. Returning after noon, Mom made French toast from the Puerto Rican bread, topped with mangoes that were not quite in season but still as good as you generally find in the Northeast. On this day we were to finally connect with the other two parties of our family who were visiting at the same time. Uncle Paul and his crew were reloacting from the San Juan leg of their trip to a condo rental in Rio Grande, while Aunt Lisa and Fred and Grandma and Grandpa were to arrive early that afternoon from Baltimore.</p>

  <p>Mom made breakfast in our little kitchen. The kitchen itself was not outfit well for serious cooking. There was no oven, and finding simple things like mixing bowls was a little difficult. Nevertheless the challenge was nothing Mom was not up to, and we enjoyed scrambled eggs and toast made with pan de agua.</p>
<p>Afterwards we packed up and went to Luquillo Beach, just a mile or so farther down the coastline. You could see it from our apartment and hear it too, beacuse for most of the time loud music was playing near the water and the bass would make it all the way to our ears. The beach itself was dominated by locals. We all noticed how they seemed to have less stress about body image than mainland Americans, since all manner of human body was hanging comfortably out of swimsuits wherever we looked.</p>

  <p>Mom, Mark and I had a 7am departure from the airport. I elected to take the trolley to the regional rail in order to arrive around 5:30. I was in a hurry and so drove to the trolley stop and ended up getting $60 in parking tickets because of street cleaning. Oops. The Southwest flight attendants were of unusually good humor and we arrived without event around 1pm. At the airport we met Samantha and Jace.</p>
<p>We were immediately impressed by the heat, humidity, and intensity of sunlight. It seemed we pale northeasterners might wilt in the island heat, especially as we waited for Mark to unlose himself en route back to the airport with the rental car. However we would soon be acclimated to the weather and find it rather pleasant.</p>
<p>We considered meeting up with Uncle Paul and family in Old San Juan where they were staying until Sunday, but not having a map or a great idea where we were going, and our landlady being insistent about meeting us at our rental apartment in Luquillo, we continued on straight. “TU MUNDO ES LIBERTY” greeted us from a mountainside as we drove east on 66.</p>

  <p>A recurring motif in dreams in which my father appears is that I embrace him.</p>
<p>The embrace is one part joy at having him wth me again and one part fear of losing him again.</p>
<p>Ten years after his death I am glad that I still have these dreams. These emotions ought not be buried beneath forgetfulness. And the dreams remind me to pray that they come true.</p>

  <p>Biycycles are inanimate, but there remains a deep affection of the rider for his mount. This affection can extend even to identification.</p>
<p>I took my bike to the bike shop this weekend and it was cathartic. The bike was already in a shop, but I took it to Via Bicycle where they were more likely to have a matching fork in the event a replacement was necessary. To myself I jokingly called the move a “patient transfer.”</p>
<p>The owner of Via Bicycle reintroduced himself as Curtis, but with a moustache and a manner with a crowd of customers like his no reintroduction was necessary. Curtis lives up to this image, too; it’s not an exaggeratin to call him a bicycle sage.</p>
<p>Curtis put my bike on a stand and told me about its damage, his eyes finding in a minute what others’ instruments had missed. This after the car accident that put me out of commission for almost five months.</p>

  <p>I am not very good at getting chores done.</p>
<p>I find the simple act of making a list of tasks greatly increases the likelihood that I will do them. I can have a task in my mind for weeks without doing it, even if it is as simple as a phone call. Yet somehow when I make the list something clicks and I start knocking off items.</p>
<p>Who knew?</p>

  <p>I had a beautiful dream last night.</p>
<p>The whole world was anxious about something in outer space that was headed for Earth. It was visible in the night sky as a dark green star moving toward the zenith. We didn’t know what it was but we all remembered what happened to the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>When it got close, something from Earth went up and met it. Green turned to blue. I was relieved to infer that it would not be colliding with us, but in the next moment I realized the fallout from that interaction would be reaching us momentarily and for all I knew we were still going to get it.</p>
<p>I called my mom to warn her to take cover and I braced myself inside a narrow closet. I feared for all of the people who would be out in the open, unaware of the danger we still faced. Then the moment arrived.</p>
