  <p>Biycycles are inanimate, but there remains a deep affection of the rider for his mount. This affection can extend even to identification.</p>
<p>I took my bike to the bike shop this weekend and it was cathartic. The bike was already in a shop, but I took it to Via Bicycle where they were more likely to have a matching fork in the event a replacement was necessary. To myself I jokingly called the move a “patient transfer.”</p>
<p>The owner of Via Bicycle reintroduced himself as Curtis, but with a moustache and a manner with a crowd of customers like his no reintroduction was necessary. Curtis lives up to this image, too; it’s not an exaggeratin to call him a bicycle sage.</p>
<p>Curtis put my bike on a stand and told me about its damage, his eyes finding in a minute what others’ instruments had missed. This after the car accident that put me out of commission for almost five months.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<p>At first glance the bike was okay. But Curtis had me crouch a bit and look at the top tube at eye level. Yup, now that I looked at it, it definitely bent downward near the front. Not so much the integrity was threatened, but enough to notice, and matter.</p>
<p>Come to look at it, the handlebars were bent, too. The brake lever was way off line, the headset worse for the wear. The scuffs on the cork tape revealed an intimate acquaintance with the road.</p>
<p>There was considerably more damage than met the casual eye. There is an identification of the rider with his mount.</p>
