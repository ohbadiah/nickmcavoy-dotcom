  <p>I bought a car with a nice stereo system last fall. This feature was important to me. My last car had no working stereo by the time I got rid of it. I often find driving a frustrating waste of time, and I thought having good listening would go a long way to making better use of the time and disliking it less.</p>
<p>That proved mostly true. Mornings on the way to work I basked in auditory splendor. I delighted in the music, and driving was a little better. But something else happened too. I started to develop a tolerance.</p>
<!-- MORE -->

<p>Albums go really far for me. It takes maybe three listens before even know whether or not I like an album, and I can listen to a good CD dozens of times without tiring of it. But as I continued listening to sixty to ninety minutes of music per day, that began to change. I moved through albums more quickly. What was worse, I seemed to be enjoying them less.</p>
<p>I wondered if a kind of obesity was coming upon me. Were I to eat a sumptuous feast each night for dinner, it would quickly be obvious that constant indulgence even of very good things was not healthy. As a result I decided to experiment with a more restricted musical diet. During Lent, I would only allow myself to play recorded music on the feast day, Sunday.</p>
<p>The experiment was more successful even than I expected. I mostly enjoyed the respite during Lent, but the real surprise came afterward when I first tried to listen to <em>A Walking Fire</em> by Brooklyn Rider. Quite analogous to the first meal after a fast, my sensibilities were sharpened and the music came to me more richly and intensely. This was so much the case that well before the end of the album I was “stuffed.” I had taken in quite enough music for the day, and listening even to the whole album made me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It is now well past Pentecost and my listening habits have not really changed. I regularly go more than a week without playing music now. That’s because my faculties are so much sharper that one listen can last me a long time. Last Tuesday evening I listened to <em>Appalachian Journey</em>, and this morning it was still running through my head.</p>
<p>Another consequence of listening to music less is that I listen to less music. I do not put on music just to have it in the background, and as a result I never listen to the music that I would only play for such purposes. In the extreme you could say that I have not been eating potato chips, but only juicy steak.</p>
<p>Maybe I will enter a phase where I want to explore more new music. Hopefully music I deem worthy of such exploration will also be deemed worthy of my attention. In a media landscape that constantly fractures attention, it’s nice to have some focus.</p>
