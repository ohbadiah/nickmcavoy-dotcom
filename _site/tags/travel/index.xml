  <p>Prior to the trip I entertained the thought of finding a Puerto Rican church to go to. Once there I even looked up a Presbyterian church in nearby Rio Grande. Not sure how I would get there, I thought I could at least tag along with Mom and Mark to mass. As it played out, however, I simply slept too late to do any of that.</p>
<p>They evidently endured quite a long sermon of which Mark understood zero words. Returning after noon, Mom made French toast from the Puerto Rican bread, topped with mangoes that were not quite in season but still as good as you generally find in the Northeast. On this day we were to finally connect with the other two parties of our family who were visiting at the same time. Uncle Paul and his crew were reloacting from the San Juan leg of their trip to a condo rental in Rio Grande, while Aunt Lisa and Fred and Grandma and Grandpa were to arrive early that afternoon from Baltimore.</p>

<p>We hoped to go that afternoon to a lechonera in Guavate, central Puerto Rico. Lechón is the Puerto Rican way of preparing and spit roasting whole pigs. The pork is seasoned with adobo and incredibly tender. We thought we had to go on Sundays because of the mention of a New York Times travel article. But there were a lot of moving pieces. Aside from my grandparents’ imminent arrival, I also hoped to meet with our closest and only remaining Puerto Rican relative living on the island, my grandmother’s first cousin Mr. Enrique Coto. As it turned out, while Sunday is indeed the big day for Puerto Ricans to have such excursions, lechoneras are open seven days, my grandparents would not be in any shape to turn around and drive for two hours after arriving in Luquillo, and Ricky was already at the lechonera by noon. We shelved the plan for later in the week, hoping to make it a waystation on our way to my great grandmother’s native Ponce.</p>
<p>Since that plan was shelved, the McAvoys and Irelands among us decided to try and visit the famous bioluminescent bay in nearby Fajardo. This is a small inlet where certain plankton thrive off of the roots of mangrove trees lining the banks, and when they are disturbed they glow. Mom and Samantha and I vividly remembered the Bay from our 2004 visit to the island. We remembered glowing as blue as Obi Wan Kenobi as we swam in the bay (now illegal, oops) and seeing the fish stream next to the boat like shooting stars below us. At that time we just found and independent boat owner for hire, but we struggled to find such an arrangement this time. Most tours were by kayak, which no one but Samantha was enthused by, and all seemed to be in the $50 per head range. So we thought we would head out for Fajardo and try and recapture the magic.</p>
<p>We did find a kmart in Fajardo where Samantha and Jace bought long pants for potential horseback riding later in the day or week. We also found people riding horses in the street. We found the ferry terminal where we could ship out to the nearby island of Culebra and its perfect beaches. We found construction, and a resort, and restaurants, and poor housing, and many speedbumps, and even a marina. We saw the beautiful picnic area along the water there near the Las Cabezas de San Juan reserve in which the Bay was found. But we did not find our boat captain in shining armor. Resigned to the information we previously found online, we returned home a bit worse for the wear.</p>
<p>For dinner we were to meet Mark at the kioscos. We could see the lots to the kioscos were jam packed. It seemed Sunday was indeed the day Puerto Ricans have outings. We parked a little ways away on a beach road and walked there, past many beach parties and more loud music. Our only constraint for dinner was the place needed to have a TV so that Mark could watch USA vs Portugal in the World Cup. I did not mind seeing the game myself. We ended up at an Italian-Puerto Rican place called Ossobucco.</p>
<p>At Ossobucco I learned that my faculties for judging books by their covers were not nearly so effective in Puerto Rico as they were back home. Judging by appearances, particularly the beat-up and hard-to-read menu, I did not think the food would be very good. But I was quite wrong. In my opinion this was the best restaurant meal of the trip. Mom and I shared arepas, something of a first for each of us and quite delicious. The tostones (fried sliced plantains) here were just what tostones ought to be, hot and salty, and just what they were not always at other places. My seafood paella came in a long plate that conjured images of Spanish sail ships and was remarkable. I topped it off with a memorably delicious and refreshing mojito. Others had the likes of mofongo and churrasco steak, while Mom outright ordered pasta. Sam drank straight from a coconut.</p>
<p>On the walk back to our car Sam saw a shooting star. Or was it Mom? The sky and the water were the same shade of grey-black, and whispy grey clouds complemented the sea breeze. That night we left the French doors open, the breeze persuading predatory insects to mostly leave us alone.</p>

  <p>Mom made breakfast in our little kitchen. The kitchen itself was not outfit well for serious cooking. There was no oven, and finding simple things like mixing bowls was a little difficult. Nevertheless the challenge was nothing Mom was not up to, and we enjoyed scrambled eggs and toast made with pan de agua.</p>
<p>Afterwards we packed up and went to Luquillo Beach, just a mile or so farther down the coastline. You could see it from our apartment and hear it too, beacuse for most of the time loud music was playing near the water and the bass would make it all the way to our ears. The beach itself was dominated by locals. We all noticed how they seemed to have less stress about body image than mainland Americans, since all manner of human body was hanging comfortably out of swimsuits wherever we looked.</p>

<p>The sand wasn’t anything too special and you did seem to have to watch out for ants. The water, however, was wonderful. Cool, still, clear, and very salty, it was effortless to float in. The four of us without Mark actually held hands in a chain floating on our backs at one point. Floating there and seeing the sun through your eyelids felt something like a return to the womb. I enjoyed swimming for the first time since my auto accident last fall, finding the water resistance good for my recovering joints.</p>
<p>At lunchtime we left our towels and beach things and made for the kioscos on foot. We observed more comfortable Puerto Rican bodies, some games in the sand, and some impressive coniferous trees. Eventually we got to a point where we would need to walk across a narrow row of cinderblocks over a small concrete structure over a pond, or walk around a long way. We decided to go the short way, and one or two of us found the big step across the middle of the bridge to be on the frightening side. Mom paused for a good while, frozen. I was last in line and too felt a pang of hesitation when it was my time, but Sam told me there was someone waiting behind me, I suddenly realized it was no big deal, and with the problem solved in my mind I went across without any further problem. On the way back we took the longer way.</p>
<p>There was some disagreement about our lunch location. All of the places seemed identical with the same fried Puerto Rican dishes like plantains or pasteles in the window. Samantha favored the first place we walked through since it was full of locals, but Mom and I did not want to be around the likes of a man who had been on a slot machine for far too long (there were slots in the restaurant). We ended up at a place called the Ceviche Hut, more unique than the other places but more expensive as well. Each of the couples split a dish while I actually ordered ceviche, which I found delightful.</p>
<p>We were not back in the water for long before our big incident of the day occurred. Mark remained on the shore while the rest of us swam more. He got up to buy some ice cream, leaving his wallet and mine in the cooler with our stuff. A group of youths next to us had been drinking all day and did not seem to be up to much good. Mark kept an eye on the wallets and saw one of them take the wallets and take off.</p>
<p>From my perspective in the water (under the shadow of misty El Yunque far in the distance) I said to Mom, “Hey, Mark is running really fast.” I thought he must have found a game with some locals. Mom’s guess was far more accurate. “I wonder if someone stole the wallets.”</p>
<p>Give adrenaline and Mark some credit. Drunk or no, Mark had 40 years on the thief, but he caught him quickly. The kid evidently realized that Mark was going to catch and tackle him and was so afraid he just threw the wallets away. This after attempting to blend in with his friends who all tried to play dumb.</p>
<p>By the time first I then the rest of us arrived from the beach, Mark was sitting on the cooler confronted with 3 of the other drunken youths. They were obnoxious in their attempts at conciliation, trying to get Mark to offer a handshake. “You can’t do bad in life. You got to do good in life. Jesus wouldn’t approve of him or what you were doing today,” he warned them sternly.</p>
<p>With that we certainly were not going to stick around at the beach. We packed up. On our way out we came across beach patrollwomen. Mark told them about the incident and tried to go with them to find the men. This made a bit more of a spectacle than we already had on our hands. “I’m so sorry about this,” one dear woman said to us as she passed. Nothing much came of the patrol, and we left.</p>
<p>Dinner that night was cheeseburgers at home. We were beginning to learn that Amigo was not the best place to spend our vacation. The lines were just slow moving and the drive was just a bit out of the way. Dinner at any rate was quite serviceable, and we discovered the kitchen was far better outfit for mixing drinks than it was for real food. Samantha and Jace and I followed the old adage (“When in rum [country], do as the rum [drinkers] do”) and made delicious piña coladas which we sipped from tall coqui-printed glasses.</p>
<p>As night drew on we closed the French doors on the balcony, shutting ocean and mosquitos out and air conditioning in.</p>
